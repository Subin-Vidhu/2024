Month 1: Investment = 10,000, Interest = 10,000 x 12% = 1,200, Total Amount = 10,000 + 1,200 = 11,200
Month 2: Investment = 10,000, Total Amount = 11,200 + 10,000 = 21,200, Interest = 21,200 x 12% = 2,544, New Total Amount = 21,200 + 2,544 = $23,744
Month 3: Investment = 10,000, Total Amount = 23,744 + 10,000 = 33,744, Interest = 33,744 x 12% = 4,049, New Total Amount = 33,744 + 4,049 = $37,793
