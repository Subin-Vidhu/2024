## Basic Time Functions

### Getting the Current Time
The `time()` function returns the current time as a floating-point number representing seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).

```python
import time

current_time = time.time()
print(f"Current time: {current_time}")
```

### Converting Time to a String
The `ctime()` function converts a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string.

```python
import time

current_time = time.time()
time_string = time.ctime(current_time)
print(f"Current time as string: {time_string}")
```

### Converting struct_time to Seconds
The `mktime()` function converts a `struct_time` object to seconds since the epoch.

```python
import time

# Create a struct_time object
time_tuple = (2023, 5, 17, 14, 30, 0, 2, 137, 1)
struct_time = time.struct_time(time_tuple)

# Convert to seconds since the epoch
seconds = time.mktime(struct_time)
print(f"Seconds since epoch: {seconds}")
```

### Converting struct_time to a String
The `asctime()` function converts a `struct_time` object to a string in the format "Day Mon DD HH:MM:SS YYYY".

```python
import time

current_time = time.localtime()
time_string = time.asctime(current_time)
print(f"Current time as string: {time_string}")
```

## Time Formatting and Parsing

### Formatting Time with strftime()
The `strftime()` function formats time according to a specified format string.

```python
import time

current_time = time.localtime()
formatted_time = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", current_time)
print(f"Formatted time: {formatted_time}")
```

### Parsing Time with strptime()
The `strptime()` function parses a string representing time according to a specified format.

```python
import time

time_string = "2023-05-17 14:30:00"
parsed_time = time.strptime(time_string, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(f"Parsed time: {parsed_time}")
```

## Sleep and Performance Measurement

### Introducing Delays with sleep()
The `sleep()` function suspends execution for a given number of seconds.

```python
import time

print("Start")
time.sleep(2)  # Pause for 2 seconds
print("End")
```

### Measuring Execution Time
Python's `time` module offers several functions for measuring execution time, each with its own use case:

#### Using time()
The `time()` function can be used to measure wall-clock time:

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()

# Your code here
for i in range(1000000):
    pass

end_time = time.time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Wall-clock time: {execution_time} seconds")
```

#### Using perf_counter()
For more precise timing of short durations, use `perf_counter()`:

```python
import time

start_time = time.perf_counter()

# Your code here
for i in range(1000000):
    pass

end_time = time.perf_counter()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Performance counter time: {execution_time} seconds")
```

#### Using process_time()
To measure CPU time used by the current process:

```python
import time

start_time = time.process_time()

# Your code here
for i in range(1000000):
    pass

end_time = time.process_time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"CPU time used: {execution_time} seconds")
```

#### Using thread_time()
To measure CPU time used by the current thread:

```python
import time

start_time = time.thread_time()

# Your code here
for i in range(1000000):
    pass

end_time = time.thread_time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Thread CPU time used: {execution_time} seconds")
```

## Working with Time Structures

### Using struct_time
The `struct_time` object represents a time as a named tuple with nine attributes.

```python
import time

current_time = time.localtime()
print(f"Year: {current_time.tm_year}")
print(f"Month: {current_time.tm_mon}")
print(f"Day: {current_time.tm_mday}")
print(f"Hour: {current_time.tm_hour}")
print(f"Minute: {current_time.tm_min}")
print(f"Second: {current_time.tm_sec}")
print(f"Weekday: {current_time.tm_wday}")  # 0 is Monday
print(f"Year day: {current_time.tm_yday}")  # 1 to 366
print(f"DST: {current_time.tm_isdst}")  # 0, 1 or -1
```

### Converting struct_time to Seconds
The `mktime()` function converts a `struct_time` object to seconds since the epoch.

```python
import time

current_time = time.localtime()
seconds = time.mktime(current_time)
print(f"Seconds since epoch: {seconds}")
```

### Converting struct_time to String
The `asctime()` function converts a `struct_time` object to a string.

```python
import time

current_time = time.localtime()
time_string = time.asctime(current_time)
print(f"Time as string: {time_string}")
```

## Time Zones and Daylight Saving Time

### Getting GMT Time
The `gmtime()` function returns the current GMT time as a `struct_time` object.

```python
import time

gmt_time = time.gmtime()
print(f"Current GMT time: {time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', gmt_time)}")
```

### Checking Daylight Saving Time
The `tm_isdst` attribute of `struct_time` indicates whether Daylight Saving Time is in effect.

```python
import time

current_time = time.localtime()
is_dst = current_time.tm_isdst
print(f"Is Daylight Saving Time in effect? {'Yes' if is_dst else 'No'}")
```

### Setting Time Zone
The `tzset()` function sets the time zone based on the environment variable TZ.

```python
import time
import os

os.environ['TZ'] = 'US/Pacific'
time.tzset()
print(f"Current time zone: {time.tzname}")
```

### Time Zone Constants
The `time` module provides several constants related to time zones:

- `time.altzone`: The offset of the alternate timezone in seconds
- `time.daylight`: Indicates whether the timezone uses daylight saving time
- `time.timezone`: The offset of the local timezone in seconds
- `time.tzname`: A tuple containing the name of the local timezone

```python
import time

print(f"Alternate timezone offset: {time.altzone} seconds")
print(f"Daylight saving time used: {time.daylight}")
print(f"Local timezone offset: {time.timezone} seconds")
print(f"Local timezone name: {time.tzname}")
```

## Advanced Usage and Error Handling

### Error Handling with strptime()
When parsing time strings, it's important to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions.

```python
import time

time_string = "2023-05-17 25:30:00"  # Invalid hour

try:
    parsed_time = time.strptime(time_string, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    print(f"Parsed time: {parsed_time}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error parsing time: {e}")
```

### Performance Measurement Functions

#### process_time()
The `process_time()` function returns the sum of the system and user CPU time of the current process.

```python
import time

start = time.process_time()

# Your code here
for i in range(1000000):
    pass

end = time.process_time()
print(f"CPU time used: {end - start} seconds")
```

#### perf_counter()
The `perf_counter()` function provides a high-resolution timer for measuring short durations.

```python
import time

start = time.perf_counter()

# Your code here
for i in range(1000000):
    pass

end = time.perf_counter()
print(f"Elapsed time: {end - start} seconds")
```

#### thread_time()
The `thread_time()` function measures CPU time for the current thread.

```python
import time

start = time.thread_time()

# Your code here
for i in range(1000000):
    pass

end = time.thread_time()
print(f"Thread CPU time: {end - start} seconds")
```

### Best Practices
1. Use `time.time()` for timestamps and general timekeeping.
2. Prefer `time.perf_counter()` for measuring short code execution times.
3. Use `time.process_time()` or `time.thread_time()` when you need to measure CPU time specifically.
4. Always handle exceptions when parsing time strings with `strptime()`.
5. Be aware of timezone differences when working with times from different sources.
