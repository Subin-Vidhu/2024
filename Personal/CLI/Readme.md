#### Comparison

- All three libraries provide a similar way of defining CLI tools, but with some differences:

    - Argparse is more verbose and requires more boilerplate code.
    - Click is more flexible and powerful, but requires more setup.
    - Typer is the most Pythonic and easiest to use, but is built on top of Click.

- When to use each library?

    - Use Argparse when you need a simple CLI tool and don't want to install any extra libraries.
    - Use Click when you need more flexibility and power in your CLI tool.
    - Use Typer when you want a modern, Pythonic way of building CLI tools and don't mind installing an extra library.
