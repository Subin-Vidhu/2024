## Pixel Accuracy

Pixel Accuracy is a simple and intuitive metric for evaluating segmentation models. It measures the proportion of correctly classified pixels across all classes.

### Purpose and Significance
Pixel Accuracy provides a quick overview of the model's performance. However, it can be misleading in cases of class imbalance, where a model might achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the dominant class for all pixels.

### Calculation Method
Pixel Accuracy is calculated as:

```
Pixel Accuracy = (Number of correctly classified pixels) / (Total number of pixels)
```

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, Pixel Accuracy is calculated using the `calculate_metric` function with the 'pixel_accuracy' option. The function takes the ground truth (`y_true`) and predicted (`y_pred`) tensors as inputs.

```python
pixel_accuracy = calculate_metric(y_true, y_pred, None, 'pixel_accuracy')
```

### Conceptual Example
Consider a 4x4 image segmentation task with two classes (background and object):

Ground Truth:
```
0 0 1 1
0 0 1 1
1 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
```

Model Prediction:
```
0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
1 0 0 0
```

In this example:
- Total pixels: 16
- Correctly classified pixels: 13

Pixel Accuracy = 13 / 16 = 0.8125 or 81.25%

This indicates that the model correctly classified 81.25% of the pixels in the image.

## Mean IoU

Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU) is a popular metric for evaluating segmentation models. It provides a more balanced assessment of the model's performance across all classes, especially in cases of class imbalance.

### Purpose and Significance
Mean IoU is particularly useful when dealing with multi-class segmentation problems or when classes are imbalanced. It gives equal weight to each class, regardless of their frequency in the dataset, providing a more robust evaluation of the model's performance across all classes.

### Calculation Method
Mean IoU is calculated by first computing the IoU for each class and then taking the average:

1. For each class:
   ```
   IoU = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives + False Negatives)
   ```
2. Mean IoU:
   ```
   Mean IoU = (Sum of IoU for all classes) / (Number of classes)
   ```

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, Mean IoU is calculated using the `calculate_metric` function with the 'mean_iou' option. The function takes the ground truth (`y_true`) and predicted (`y_pred`) tensors as inputs.

```python
mean_iou = calculate_metric(y_true, y_pred, None, 'mean_iou')
```

### Conceptual Example
Consider a 4x4 image segmentation task with three classes (0, 1, 2):

Ground Truth:
```
0 0 1 1
0 0 1 1
2 2 0 0
2 2 0 0
```

Model Prediction:
```
0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1
2 2 0 0
2 1 0 0
```

Calculating IoU for each class:

Class 0:
- True Positives: 5
- False Positives: 0
- False Negatives: 1
IoU_0 = 5 / (5 + 0 + 1) = 0.833

Class 1:
- True Positives: 3
- False Positives: 2
- False Negatives: 1
IoU_1 = 3 / (3 + 2 + 1) = 0.5

Class 2:
- True Positives: 3
- False Positives: 0
- False Negatives: 1
IoU_2 = 3 / (3 + 0 + 1) = 0.75

Mean IoU = (0.833 + 0.5 + 0.75) / 3 = 0.694 or 69.4%

This indicates that the model has an average IoU of 69.4% across all classes, providing a balanced measure of its performance.

## Per-class Metrics

### IoU (Intersection over Union)

IoU is a metric that measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth for each class.

#### Purpose and Significance
IoU is particularly useful for evaluating the accuracy of object detection and segmentation tasks. It provides a measure of how well the predicted region aligns with the actual region of interest.

#### Calculation Method
IoU is calculated as:
```
IoU = (Area of Overlap) / (Area of Union)
```

#### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, IoU is calculated using the `calculate_metric` function with the 'iou' option:

```python
iou = calculate_metric(y_true, y_pred, i, 'iou')
```

#### Conceptual Example
Consider a 4x4 image with one object:

Ground Truth:
```
0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1
0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0
```

Prediction:
```
0 0 1 1
0 1 1 1
1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0
```

Overlap (True Positives): 5
Union (True Positives + False Positives + False Negatives): 5 + 2 + 1 = 8
IoU = 5 / 8 = 0.625 or 62.5%

### Dice Coefficient

The Dice Coefficient, also known as the F1 score in binary classification, measures the overlap between two samples.

#### Purpose and Significance
The Dice Coefficient is particularly useful in medical image segmentation tasks. It's less sensitive to imbalanced datasets compared to pixel accuracy.

#### Calculation Method
The Dice Coefficient is calculated as:
```
Dice = (2 * |X ∩ Y|) / (|X| + |Y|)
```
Where X and Y are the predicted and ground truth segmentations.

#### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, the Dice Coefficient is calculated using the `calculate_metric` function with the 'dice' option:

```python
dice = calculate_metric(y_true, y_pred, i, 'dice')
```

#### Conceptual Example
Using the same 4x4 image from the IoU example:

True Positives: 5
False Positives: 2
False Negatives: 1

Dice = (2 * 5) / (5 + 2 + 5 + 1) = 10 / 13 ≈ 0.769 or 76.9%

### Precision

Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all predicted positive instances.

#### Purpose and Significance
Precision is crucial when the cost of false positives is high. It answers the question: "Of all the instances the model labeled as positive, how many actually are positive?"

#### Calculation Method
Precision is calculated as:
```
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
```

#### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, Precision is calculated using the `calculate_metric` function with the 'precision' option:

```python
precision = calculate_metric(y_true, y_pred, i, 'precision')
```

#### Conceptual Example
Using the same 4x4 image:

True Positives: 5
False Positives: 2

Precision = 5 / (5 + 2) = 5 / 7 ≈ 0.714 or 71.4%

### Recall

Recall measures the proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly identified.

#### Purpose and Significance
Recall is important when the cost of false negatives is high. It answers the question: "Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly identify?"

#### Calculation Method
Recall is calculated as:
```
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
```

#### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, Recall is calculated using the `calculate_metric` function with the 'recall' option:

```python
recall = calculate_metric(y_true, y_pred, i, 'recall')
```

#### Conceptual Example
Using the same 4x4 image:

True Positives: 5
False Negatives: 1

Recall = 5 / (5 + 1) = 5 / 6 ≈ 0.833 or 83.3%

### F1 Score

The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single score that balances both metrics.

#### Purpose and Significance
The F1 Score is particularly useful when you have an uneven class distribution and want to seek a balance between Precision and Recall.

#### Calculation Method
F1 Score is calculated as:
```
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

#### Input Handling in Code
While not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the F1 Score can be calculated using the previously computed precision and recall values:

```python
f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
```

#### Conceptual Example
Using the Precision and Recall from previous examples:

Precision = 0.714
Recall = 0.833

F1 Score = 2 * (0.714 * 0.833) / (0.714 + 0.833) ≈ 0.769 or 76.9%

## Cohen's Kappa

Cohen's Kappa is a statistic that measures inter-rater agreement for categorical items.

### Purpose and Significance
In the context of image segmentation, Cohen's Kappa can be used to measure the agreement between the model's predictions and the ground truth, while taking into account the agreement that might occur by chance.

### Calculation Method
Cohen's Kappa is calculated as:
```
κ = (po - pe) / (1 - pe)
```
Where:
- po is the observed agreement (equivalent to accuracy)
- pe is the expected agreement (probability of random agreement)

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, Cohen's Kappa can be calculated using scikit-learn's `cohen_kappa_score` function:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import cohen_kappa_score

kappa = cohen_kappa_score(y_true.flatten(), y_pred.flatten())
```

### Conceptual Example
Consider a 3x3 image with two classes:

Ground Truth:
```
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1
```

Prediction:
```
0 0 1
0 0 1
1 1 1
```

Observed agreement (po) = 7/9 ≈ 0.778
Expected agreement (pe) = ((4/9 * 3/9) + (5/9 * 6/9)) ≈ 0.556

κ = (0.778 - 0.556) / (1 - 0.556) ≈ 0.5

This indicates moderate agreement between the prediction and ground truth.

## Confusion Matrix

The Confusion Matrix is a table that describes the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known.

### Purpose and Significance
A Confusion Matrix provides a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications for each class. It's particularly useful for understanding the types of errors a model is making and for identifying potential biases in the model's predictions.

### Calculation Method
For a binary classification problem, the Confusion Matrix is typically a 2x2 table:

```
                 Predicted Negative | Predicted Positive
Actual Negative       TN            |        FP
Actual Positive       FN            |        TP
```

Where:
- TN: True Negatives
- FP: False Positives
- FN: False Negatives
- TP: True Positives

For multi-class problems, the matrix expands to show all possible class combinations.

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, the Confusion Matrix can be calculated and plotted using the `plot_confusion_matrix` function:

```python
plot_confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, class_names)
```

### Conceptual Example
Consider a 3-class segmentation problem with classes: Background (0), Object A (1), and Object B (2). Given the following predictions and ground truth for a set of pixels:

Ground Truth: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2]
Predictions:  [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2]

The resulting Confusion Matrix would be:

```
    Pred 0 | Pred 1 | Pred 2
  +--------------------------
0 |   2    |   1    |   0
1 |   0    |   3    |   0
2 |   1    |   0    |   2
```

This matrix shows that the model correctly classified 2 background pixels, 3 Object A pixels, and 2 Object B pixels. It misclassified 1 background pixel as Object A, and 1 Object B pixel as background.

## ROC Curves

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are graphical plots that illustrate the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.

### Purpose and Significance
ROC curves are useful for evaluating the trade-off between true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various classification thresholds. They help in selecting an optimal threshold for classification and comparing different models' performances.

### Calculation Method
1. For each possible threshold:
   - Calculate True Positive Rate (TPR) = TP / (TP + FN)
   - Calculate False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP / (FP + TN)
2. Plot TPR against FPR for all thresholds

The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) is often used as a single-number summary of the curve's performance.

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, ROC curves can be plotted using the `plot_roc_curves` function:

```python
plot_roc_curves(y_true, y_pred_prob, class_names)
```

Where `y_pred_prob` are the predicted probabilities for each class.

### Conceptual Example
Consider a binary classification problem with the following predictions and ground truth:

Ground Truth: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
Predicted Probabilities: [0.1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.9, 0.4]

At threshold 0.5:
TPR = 3/4 = 0.75
FPR = 1/4 = 0.25

This would be one point on the ROC curve. By varying the threshold, we can plot the entire curve.

A perfect classifier would have a point at (0,1), representing 100% TPR and 0% FPR. The diagonal line y = x represents the performance of a random classifier.

## Precision-Recall Curves

Precision-Recall (PR) curves are graphical plots that illustrate the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds in a binary classification problem.

### Purpose and Significance
PR curves are particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. They help in understanding the model's performance across different classification thresholds and are especially informative when the positive class is rare or when you care more about positive predictions.

### Calculation Method
1. For each possible threshold:
   - Calculate Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
   - Calculate Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
2. Plot Precision against Recall for all thresholds

The Area Under the PR Curve (AUC-PR) is often used as a single-number summary of the curve's performance.

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, PR curves can be plotted using the `plot_pr_curves` function:

```python
plot_pr_curves(y_true, y_pred_prob, class_names)
```

Where `y_pred_prob` are the predicted probabilities for each class.

### Conceptual Example
Consider a binary classification problem with the following predictions and ground truth:

Ground Truth: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
Predicted Probabilities: [0.1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.9, 0.4]

At threshold 0.5:
Precision = 3/4 = 0.75
Recall = 3/4 = 0.75

This would be one point on the PR curve. By varying the threshold, we can plot the entire curve.

A perfect classifier would have a point at (1,1), representing 100% precision and 100% recall. The baseline for comparison is often the performance of a random classifier, which would have a precision equal to the proportion of positive samples in the dataset.

## Error Type Analysis

Error Type Analysis is a technique used to categorize and understand the different types of errors made by a segmentation model.

### Purpose and Significance
This analysis helps in identifying specific weaknesses of the model, such as over-segmentation, under-segmentation, or misclassification. Understanding these error types can guide targeted improvements in the model or data collection process.

### Calculation Method
1. Compare the predicted segmentation with the ground truth
2. Categorize errors into types such as:
   - False Positives (Over-segmentation)
   - False Negatives (Under-segmentation)
   - Misclassification (Correct detection but wrong class)

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, error type analysis can be performed using the `analyze_error_types` function:

```python
analyze_error_types(y_true, y_pred, class_names)
```

### Conceptual Example
Consider a simple 3x3 image segmentation task with two classes (0: background, 1: object):

Ground Truth:
```
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1
```

Prediction:
```
0 1 1
0 0 1
1 1 0
```

Error Analysis:
- False Positive (Over-segmentation): (0,1)
- False Negative (Under-segmentation): (1,1), (2,2)
- Misclassification: None in this case

This analysis shows that the model tends to slightly over-segment in one area and under-segment in two areas, providing insights for potential improvements.

## Segmentation Overlay Visualization

Segmentation Overlay Visualization is a technique used to visually compare the predicted segmentation with the ground truth by overlaying them on the original image.

### Purpose and Significance
This visualization helps in quickly identifying areas where the model performs well and where it struggles. It provides an intuitive way to understand the spatial distribution of correct predictions and errors.

### Calculation Method
1. Start with the original input image
2. Overlay the ground truth segmentation with a specific color or pattern
3. Overlay the predicted segmentation with a different color or pattern
4. Adjust transparency to allow all layers to be visible

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, segmentation overlay visualization can be performed using the `plot_segmentation_overlay` function:

```python
plot_segmentation_overlay(image, y_true, y_pred, class_names)
```

### Conceptual Example
Consider a simple 3x3 image of a cat with two classes (0: background, 1: cat):

Original Image:
```
[Cat pixel values]
```

Ground Truth:
```
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1
```

Prediction:
```
0 1 1
0 0 1
1 1 0
```

The visualization would overlay these segmentations on the original image, perhaps using red for the ground truth outline and blue for the predicted outline. This would clearly show where the prediction matches the ground truth and where it differs.

## Uncertainty Visualization

Uncertainty Visualization is a technique used to display the model's confidence in its predictions for each pixel or region in the segmented image.

### Purpose and Significance
This visualization helps in understanding where the model is most uncertain about its predictions. Areas of high uncertainty may indicate challenging regions that require further investigation or improvement in the model.

### Calculation Method
1. For each pixel, calculate the model's confidence in its prediction (often using the softmax probabilities)
2. Create a heatmap where the color intensity represents the level of uncertainty
3. Overlay this heatmap on the original image or the segmentation result

### Input Handling in Code
In the provided code, uncertainty visualization can be performed using the `plot_uncertainty` function:

```python
plot_uncertainty(image, y_pred_prob)
```

### Conceptual Example
Consider the same 3x3 image of a cat:

Predicted Probabilities for Class 1 (Cat):
```
0.1 0.6 0.9
0.3 0.5 0.8
0.7 0.9 0.4
```

The uncertainty visualization might use a color scale where red indicates high uncertainty (probabilities close to 0.5) and blue indicates low uncertainty (probabilities close to 0 or 1). In this case, the pixel at (1,1) with a probability of 0.5 would be the most red (uncertain), while pixels like (0,0) and (2,1) would be more blue (certain).

This visualization allows researchers to quickly identify areas where the model is less confident, which could guide further data collection, model improvements, or the need for human verification in those areas.
