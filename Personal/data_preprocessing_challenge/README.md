# Data Preprocessing Challenge Setup and Execution Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the data preprocessing challenge designed to test the skills in cleaning and preparing a medical dataset for analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, requests

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn requests
   ```

## Files Description
- `data_preprocessing_challenge.md`: Contains the challenge description and instructions.
- `handle_outliers.py`: The Python script for preprocessing the dataset.

## Running the Preprocessing Script
1. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
2. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python handle_outliers.py
   ```
   This will execute the data preprocessing steps and save the cleaned dataset to a CSV file.

## Output
- `healthcare_dataset_cleaned_normalized_encoded.csv`: The preprocessed dataset ready for analysis.
