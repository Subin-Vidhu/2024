## Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Unix/MacOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the application:
   - Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
     ```json
     {
       "database": {
         "uri": "sqlite:///instance/todo.db"
       },
       "flask": {
         "secret_key": "your-secret-key",
         "debug": true
       },
       "admin": {
         "history_clear_code": "your-admin-code"
       }
     }
     ```

5. Development Mode:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   The development server will be accessible:
   - Locally: http://localhost:5000
   - Over LAN: http://<your-ip>:5000

6. Server Configuration (Recommended):
   ```
   # Generate optimal server configuration based on your system
   python system_info.py
   ```
   This will create a system_info.json file with:
   - CPU information (cores, frequency, usage)
   - Memory statistics
   - OS and system details
   - Network information (LAN IP)
   - Recommended server configuration (Gunicorn/Waitress)
   - Optimal number of workers/threads for your hardware
   - Ready-to-use server command

   Example output:
   ```
   System information has been saved to system_info.json

   System Network Information:
   LAN IP: 192.168.1.100

   Recommended server configuration:
   Server: waitress
   Recommended threads: 16
   Command: waitress-serve --port=8000 --threads=16 --host=192.168.1.100 app:app

   Access your application at: http://192.168.1.100:8000
   ```

7. Production Mode (Recommended):
   ```
   # Run the production server with optimal configuration
   python run_production.py
   ```
   This will automatically:
   - Use the optimal configuration from system_info.json
   - Set proper production environment variables
   - Use Gunicorn on Unix/Linux or Waitress on Windows
   - Configure optimal number of workers/threads for your CPU
   - Make the application accessible over LAN
   - Provide graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C

   Manual commands (if needed):
   ```
   # On Unix/MacOS/Linux
   gunicorn -w 4 -b <your-ip>:8000 app:app

   # On Windows
   waitress-serve --port=8000 --threads=16 --host=<your-ip> app:app
   ```

8. Access the Application:
   ```
   # For development mode
   Local: http://localhost:5000
   LAN: http://<your-ip>:5000

   # For production mode
   Local: http://localhost:8000
   LAN: http://<your-ip>:8000
   ```
   Replace <your-ip> with your actual LAN IP (shown by system_info.py)

### Production Deployment Notes
- Use Gunicorn in production with multiple workers (2-4x number of CPU cores)
- Configure a reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) in front of Gunicorn
- Set debug=False in config.json for production
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Usage

- Click the circle icon to mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Click the trash icon to delete individual tasks
