## Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Unix/MacOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the application:
   - Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
     ```json
     {
       "database": {
         "uri": "sqlite:///instance/todo.db"
       },
       "flask": {
         "secret_key": "your-secret-key",
         "debug": true
       },
       "admin": {
         "history_clear_code": "your-admin-code"
       }
     }
     ```

5. Development Mode:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

6. Server Configuration (Recommended):
   ```
   # Generate optimal server configuration based on your system
   python system_info.py
   ```
   This will create a system_info.json file with recommended server settings based on your CPU cores and system specifications.

7. Production Mode (Recommended):
   ```
   # On Unix/MacOS/Linux
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app

   # On Windows (using waitress as Gunicorn is not supported)
   # Use 4-8 threads per CPU core. For a 4-core CPU, 16-32 threads would be reasonable
   waitress-serve --port=8000 --threads=16 app:app
   ```
   Note: Use the command provided by system_info.py for optimal configuration on your system.

8. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   # For development mode
   http://localhost:5000

   # For production mode
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Production Deployment Notes
- Use Gunicorn in production with multiple workers (2-4x number of CPU cores)
- Configure a reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache) in front of Gunicorn
- Set debug=False in config.json for production
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
