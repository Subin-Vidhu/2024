If you find yourself interested in exploring Python further, this document points to some resources that you may find useful. If you have a background in Python or experience programming in another language, style guides are included below to suggest \"best practices\" and to provide an overview of how Python may differ from other programming languages. \n",

The core Python development team, as well as the community that supports it, have developed a great set of tutorials, documentation, and references around Python. When in doubt, this is often the first place that you should look if you run into a scary error or would like to learn more about a specific function."

For every hour that you spend learning, you should spend about twice that amount of time writing code for cool problems or working out examples. Coding is best learned through actually coding!\n",

    "* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=python) has several offerings for Python that you can take in addition to this course. These courses will go into depth into Python programming and how to use it in an applied setting \n",
    "* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) is another resources that is great for learning Python (and other programming languages). While not as focused as Cousera, this is a quick way to get up-and-running with Python\n",
    "* YouTube is another great resource for online learning and there are several \"courses\" for learning Python. We recommend trying several sets of videos to see which you like best and using multiple video series to learn since each will present the material in a slightly different way\n",
    "* There are tens of books on programming in Python that are great if you prefer to read. More so than the other resources, be sure to code what you learn. It is easy to read about coding, but you really learn to code by coding!\n",
    "* If you have a background in coding, the authors have found the tutorial at [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm) to be useful in getting started with Python. This tutorial assumes that you have some background in coding in another language"
