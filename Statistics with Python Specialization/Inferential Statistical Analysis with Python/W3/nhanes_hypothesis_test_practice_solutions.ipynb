    "Suppose we wish to compare the mean BMI between college graduates and people who have not graduated from college, focusing on women between the ages of 30 and 40.  First, consider the variance of BMI within each of these subpopulations using graphical techniques, and through the estimated subpopulation variances.  Then, calculate pooled and unpooled estimates of the standard error for the difference between the mean BMI in the two populations being compared.  Finally, test the null hypothesis that the two population means are equal, using each of the two different standard errors."

    "When we ran a test comparing an individual to themselves, as we did in part a, we were running a really interesting study called a paired study. In this type of study, you use an individual as their own control group. This type of control allows researches to account for individual differences more precisely -- when you have the option to do so, often a paired study will have the highest power because it is able to control for all of the the things that make an individual unique: many of these things may not be controlled in the study in question. \n",

You can almost imagine that there are two groups of people: those that had a first diastolic measure and a group that only had a second diastolic measure. You are now not comparing an individual to themselves. Rather, you are treating all of the measurements of the first diastolic pressure as independent from the second diastolic pressure measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that this distinction, while subtle, actually changes the direction of our decision. When running the paired study, we see there is a significant difference. When doing the independent t-test, we notice there is no significant difference. When you are setting up your study, you should always be careful and aware of how you chose to measure your subjects, what measures you are including, and how to best control for covariates that are outside of your control. In general, you should be thinking about the statistics all throughout the experimental process and not just at the end when you have all of your data. "
