# IPL-Score-Predictor

- This is just another simple yet intresting project which can approximately predict an innings score based on the data from 2008-2017 IPL season.  
- I tried training three models:  
 1. Linear Regression  
 2. Lasso  
 3. Ridge  
- and out of these surprisingly Linear regression was giving more realistic results.  
- If you liked this project star this repo.  
- This project is inspired by a similar project made by Anuj Vyas and tutorial by Krish Naik.  
- I made some improvisations in his code like I totally removed the result page and showed the results on the same page.  
- And also I took venue as a feature while training as I think that it ca really play a major role in predicting score.  
- Deployed using Flask.  
- Just run app.py and go to localhost to see the results.
