"Thanks for this video Ken.

I decided to go into Tech in 2018 by learning web development. Learnt a bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript. My goals has since evolved through this period as I got interested in python programming and Data science.

My current interest now tends towards deep learning and AI

Interesting my knowledge of front end web development will be very helpful in web scraping.",UgxFZTIzC4UPyhhX_PZ4AaABAg,0,0,2022-01-22T08:13:29Z,xpIFS6jZbe8,user_981

Hey Ken! I am almost finishing my university degreed in market research & marketing and I am going to focus in data science/data engineering. Currently my friends are telling me to buy a M1 Macbook but I am not sure about compatibilities with OSX and I am not familiarised with Macs (I have always being a Windows user).

"So basically is it modest to say that the silver bullet to get into a good role is:
‚û°Ô∏èto have had Software Engineer/Development education + experience

Else
‚û°Ô∏èto have been submerged  in roles in your current situation (sometimes very unlikely) analyst to scientist

"What I am confused on Data Science and AI with the development of web 3 is, if the data are publicly available- I guess (more like believe) the owner of the data would be kept anonymous. Although there is plenty of data out in the web, how would the business make strategies to reach to their audiences/customers? Wouldn't it be like television/radio/newspaper ads? 
Also, how would the services reach to their probable new customers/audiences? Basically how would AI work for recommendation and how would business collect data to grow their business? 
I don't think the recommendation system would be like throwing anything to the public what they want people to see (not what people want to see.). Facebook and Youtube are not hurt.",Ugyk6LM6qFBE_WIQWLB4AaABAg,1,1,2022-01-17T13:49:38Z,0jTtHYie3CU,user_4017

One of the first examples of Data Science(though it was not called Data Science then) comes from John Snow‚Äôs famous map of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak.

Sure Amazon can have a whole department for data science but a small business you might be the marketing/finance guy who is also analyzing the other data sets for the company.  The field is not dying, but with tight budgets in small to midsize companies it is hard to justify hiring hiring someone who specializes in data science but cannot do any other core business function.

"So I took this on two accounts (my main account and my burner account). The one on my main account I took without cheating and I was curious to see how I'd do. I took it almost exactly one year ago today (apparently, I took it on 1/5/21) and I passed and it's on my profile because I got in that top 30%. When I got hired and throughout all of my interviews, it literally never came up. Not once. Nobody was like, ""hey, we noticed this on your profile."" They saw my math undergrad degree, my stats grad degree I was finishing, my research, and work experience. 

On my main burner account, I took it to see if it's possible to cheat all the answers and it's super easy. I could give this to my sister who hates anything related to math/stats/programming, and if she googled all the questions she'd pass and get it on her profile. Definitely useless as an assessment.

"Ultimately the two factors are: the quality of the assessment and how well particular assessments are trusted and utilized by companies.

Google's own assessments might be fine for evaluating potential candidates for themselves or possibly other FAANG (. . . . or should that now be MAANG?) company, but is the level of expectations and requirements the same across the board for any company?

Especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow.

2 not-obvious study habits which I found helpful:
1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects.
2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project. This helped me identify important topics which I had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten, so that I could refresh my knowledge/skills.",UgxvUK7YnmwjsFwm1OB4AaABAg,10,120,2021-12-29T07:54:53Z,xpIFS6jZbe8,user_68

"""When beginning with this projects, they don't have to be original. You can go through the exact same analysis that someone else did, and still learn something. But typical learning session could just be you having someone else's project on half the screen and you typing it line-by-line and running it on other half of the screen. As you do this you can change the parameters, you can  experiment with different visuals and see how it works as you go.""

This one what i've been thinking for. i feel like i do nothing if i see someone's project and copy it to my notebook, but you just said it and i totally agree. we can experiment it with changing the code, maybe we use a different way to clean the data, or just define a function that others use repeated code, (a.k.a use DRY concept), and so on.

"My first rule of ML Engineering is that you need to spend a lot of time on two sides of Feature Engineering: The input side that creates your state, and the output side that needs to accept it to create that future state. If they would have spend more time in estimating not just the prior stage in the value chain but also the next stage, they might not have ended up in this situation. I.e. if they would have spend as much time to understand the behavior of real estate agents for example, they could have discovered that there are many cases in which they should have created a portal in which only professional real estate agents have access to that database first and can take that estimate as a suggestion and continue the process; revealing how the discrepancies come to be. This way you could get expert input from crucial parts of the value chain in front of you, ride the value chain instead of trying to compete with it. In empirical science people often underestimate the impact of qualitative data compared to quantitative data. And that is exactly what happened here.

"Hey Ken, thanks for touching on some issues which were glaring a problem.

But just to emphasis, flipping a property  to a potential buyer at a current market rate may not have been a ""good"" choice, as
current market value does not include in the renewal cost the company incurred for the house.

You also did mention the model should adjust with a volatile market - VERY TRUE !

but this does not mean Zillow should have sold properties at a lower price, when the market is down to show that real-estate business is still thriving. This could have created a property-bubble.
So their idea just backfired thinking that selling properties could spark more buying ...this market is dynamic on the back of demand and NOT supply.

""Hey the pictures look good of the houses on sale, but I would still go there and see the property myself. ""

As you said in the section ""What is the zestimate really ?""  they should have had professional opinion to get a good grip of what the house-price should be. I think the business model was to eliminate such an intermediary, so that the ""negotiation"" is downed.

Thank you for this video Ken, because I'm an aspiring ML engineer and trying to become a Data Scientist; however I want to use these skills into actual business and this video has given me an insight...

How to succeed in a business using ML/DL as tools that compliments my other skills.  Maybe become a real-estate developer who has Data Science and ML skills and not just a General ML or DS pro.

Fast forward 4-14 years later, there are self-taught programmers who don't know much math and never went to college, who are now making high 6 figures and I missed that opportunity because I listened too much to other people when I was 12.

"Hi Ken, I'm currently doing a structural biology PhD. The only experience with python/programming I have is through two things: 1) undergrad research where I was doing in silico drug screening against to protein homologs via programs such autodock followed by molecular dynamics. I had to write a few basic python scripts that made the program I was using (YASARA) run and export these simulations over about 20K small molecules per homolog. Things YASARA didn't have built in. That was 4+ years ago (took a job as a technician in a structural biology lab for about 3 years). Finally got into a PhD program but want to move into the computational side (though not entirely giving up wet-lab/experimental structure determination. I'm currently doing my lab rotations and have become more interested in methods. So for cryo-EM and crystallography using computers to help aid in determining structure, which requires ML/DL. On top of that I'm still interested in molecular dynamics of protein-ligan interactions, etc. Which might not be as influenced by data science. Lastly, I had a short course (about half a semester) that introduced R for bio/strucbio data analysis and plotting.

I've been reading a lot of theory (as that's what most professors I'm interested in working with/rotating through seem publish) but still have and am working on my python programming.

Any suggestions for this path? How does one balance graduate school with learning a new skill? The PhD route takes up so much time, how does one learn programming to slightly change projectory within their first year of grad school (to be of interest to comp bio/phys PIs but also so that one has enough experience so that they're not embarrassed or feel like they're holding the research back)?

That was long winded, but thanks!",UgzST5ENm6t-Dca3al54AaABAg,0,0,2021-11-19T02:50:05Z,VN12ZPFsApM,user_2830

read ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" if you haven't yet. It's about how we constantly make bad/wrong decisions without noticing it, and what psychological mechanisms are behind it. These mechanisms are so fundamental to our thinking that even if you are aware of them, you still are prone to making those thinking errors.

"Have you read How Not to Die? That's the book that has had the most profound impact on my life.

You talked about how our gut microbiomes affects the way that we respond to individual foods, but you didn't mention the way that what we eat impacts our gut microbiome. Eating meat adversely affects our gut microbiome, and even our gene expression. While there is plenty of room for individualizing dietary patterns to get people to eat food that they are more compatible with, the broad dietary patterns are clear. Eat minimally processed vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and minimize or eliminate your consumption of animal products, refined sugar, refined fat (oil), and processed foods. While the answer of a plant based diet is incomplete, it is at least moving in the right direction, as compared to keto and carnivore diets, which are both associated with increased all cause mortality and environmental destruction. It wouldn't surprise me that meat is worse for some people than others, but I'm extremely skeptical that it's actively good for anyone.

I'll be interested to read what they say in Personalized Diet, but I doubt they can convince me that ice cream is healthy for anyone.",Ugxee5OnTTF5rSeFUJ94AaABAg,1,1,2021-11-14T17:55:21Z,35g8fCi-kbw,user_4056

"Almost forgot: I do have a suggestion of a book in english: It's ""the bullet journal method""  by Ryder Caroll. Most sites who talk about bullet journaling have actually no idea what the method is truly about which is about focusing on important matters in your life and WHY they matter. 

Not having something beautiful or gating people out because ""your stuff is no bullet journal"".
Ie: I do mine using small binders and not a notebook and it works for me but people have told me ""this is not a bullet journal"" and yet it's still a pretty functional bullet journal.

Also, in the same vein of atomic habits, I can recommend Elasitc habits by stephen guise, he's my go to guy when it comes to habit. And this book is about having habits that adapt to the circumstances of your life. How to maintain one when things are very hard and how to maximize the benefits of a good day.",UgwQzZeHQxbCKwSxysJ4AaABAg,1,2,2021-11-12T13:43:34Z,35g8fCi-kbw,user_1105

Loved your recommendations and have read Atomic Habits myself and am considering to read Digital Minimalism. Well here are some of my recommendations which are about life and I guess psychology: 

1: *Man's search for meaning*- A must read definitely
2: *What Every body speaks* - How to read Body language
3: *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*- BF Skinner classic (an interesting read)
4: Works by *Dostoyevsky* and *Tolstoy* - you know the classics üê¢
5: *So you have been publicly shamed*- Definitely something for the social media world.
6: *Influence: the psychology of persuasion*
7:  *As a man thinketh*

"You might also be interested in the practice of self hypnosis. It helps clear the mind, relax the body and increase mental focus for, say, doing machine learning ;)

The problem is my main source of information on the subject is from a french guy named Benjamin Lubszynski. He has a youtube channel unfortunately in french and two books, also in french.

That being said I'll look for english sources for this as I believe it is a lovely habit from which everyone can benefit and its benefits are many :) (greater than meditation as it takes its source from the subconscious which makes it both more accessible than meditation but also much more effective).",UgzmmDzVX471LQigbON4AaABAg,2,2,2021-11-12T13:31:37Z,35g8fCi-kbw,user_1105

"I‚Äôm a seasoned data analyst and can say the following. The big data domain, so that‚Äôs data science (aka machine learning), data analytics and business intelligence, are tech fields, but not colourful ones. The focus is business strategy from a data-driven perspective. You do not deliver products as you will not be building or designing applications. You deliver insights, and in time this will have an impact on the business. So no fast/direct impact. Very high-level. You need to like thinking long-term about the business. So no colour, no app building, no designing. It‚Äôs all about strategy. You are not a developer; you are a strategist. So if you see yourself doing that, go for it. If you see yourself building or designing, don‚Äôt go for it and go for development/designing jobs. Now, there actually is a development type of job in the big data domain: data engineering. But that‚Äôs boring and really the data preparation work that nobody wants to do. They just prepare the data for the analysts to analyse. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sorry for all the data engineers reading this, but it‚Äôs the truth and you know it. But hey, if you have a passion for that, go for it what can I say.

"Communication, man. It is very underestimated. Most of the time, we can achieve much more if we collaborate with others. On the other hand, it requires one to have strong communication skills to manage such a collaborative organization. Unfortunately, people opt out collaborating because they fail to communicate. I am not talking about just talking to each other. I am talking about ""understanding each other"" and willing to solve problems together. 2 years ago, before my PhD oral exam, one wise professor in my PhD committee told me to relax and enjoy the process because no PhD student can be smarter than 5 professors testing you. That was a great advice, and it is very true that we are stronger together IF we can communicate to be a coherent group. 

With that said, I am wondering if there is a video about different ""data"" related roles. I am looking for internships. There are different roles, such as data engineer, data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, AI engineer, etc... I have a broad idea how they differentiate, but I would like to learn more about these roles and their requirements. I quickly skimmed your videos, Ken, but couldn't find a video about it. I mean a video including all these roles, not just comparing data analyst and data scientist. If there is one, can you point me it? If not, it would be great to see a video about that.

You are doing great work popularizing the field and making data science accessible to more people, Ken.

"Hi, I am entering into the Data Science world and I have an easy question:

 I am using Sublime Text and not Spider. When I plot my dataframe there (df = pd.read_csv('glassdoor_jobs.csv'; print(df)) I do not get a terminal where I can explore the whole data (like Ken does). Instead what I get is the df cut off. I can explore it by using some commands like "".head(20)/.tail(20)/etc..."" and specifying the columns that I want to be shown, but it's kind of annoying and you may not find some variables that need to be cleaned by doing that.

Does anyone know what could I do to display the whole dataframe outside Sublime Text to explore it?

"I agree with most of the things you said about the algorithms being so good and that it would be very inefficient for your phone to listen constantly to everything. Specifically, it would not be possible for the speech to text to happen constantly on your phone because of intense battery drain. Similarly it would also be impossible to send voice recording constantly over data because you would notice data usage from your provider. 
However, you can clearly see that when you say the keyword e.g. ""Ok google"", or ""hey Siri"" the phone is actually listening. So google could for example implement a list of keywords, that various companies want advertised, and that would also be silently monitored and when they actually find a match in the list, then they could show the ad. In essence they don't actually analyze all the things you say, they just listen for some keywords that they are interested in.",UgzwF8LfdJtVT5AYek14AaABAg,0,2,2021-09-16T20:03:13Z,nrEJGGxcoTc,user_4972

Quick Question, sometimes I get the following error:

I think It may have something to do with my internet connection, because it happens randomly during the scraping process.

I guess the question is does the file have to feature 1000 entries? I think working with a smaller data pool might prevent the random error. Will something like 500 or even 250 work?",UgyQhQZE4sE6GYu5ge14AaABAg,1,0,2021-08-24T22:40:02Z,fhi4dOhmW-g,user_1517

It was awesome, we would literally spend 10 minutes before each match just looking at the graphs to choose the best Formation.

"Hi Ken Jee, Thanks for sharing so much great info from a personal perspective. I just subscribed to your newsletter but can't leave a comment below a video. Why? Set that way, problem my end, or problem with set-up. So, for your video, A Quick Data Science Project Tip #shorts, I will comment here. Rather than try to make the Iris data set interesting with a good story (same for the Titanic one), why not just choose a more interesting dataset? Kaggle has ones on wine, California wildfires, Covid vaccines, the covid-19 virus, Olympic medals, and so many more. My tip is to take the time to find a compelling dataset for your class assignments / projects. It's better than trying to make up a great use for that boring  iris file. (I did look up ""sepal"" though and learned a lot from class examples.)

"The fact that you just said , ""the first thing to know is programming"" shows the level or lack of your mathematical understanding behind the concepts of something which might seem to be as trivial as linear regression. However, most if not all credible data scientists know the complexity of math behind the aforementioned concept , ranging from intercept interpretation to exchanging penalties with constraints in regularized models which will branch out to more non linear models like svm's using KKT theorem..

CompBio uses many disciplines and concepts in common with DS, which was a very satisfying discovery when I started to read about DS.

1. growth mindset - belief you can improve. overcoming fixed mindset
2. his close friend passed away had him realize that life is short, and he should do something meaningful within short time given to him -> identify your purpose
3. overcoming ""imposter syndrome"" by self-talking with positive words.
4. decide your identity and you will behave according to your identity automatically.
5. just like a game, create proper environment for studying, set a clear goal, give immediate feedback to stay focused
6. practice how to read -> ended up enjoy reading -> helped studying
7. create a simple routine first -> add routines/habit gradually. busy you get, more efficiency in time consuming. 
8. there are vast areas you could study. your time & energy is limited. therefore, narrow it down to specific area you're really interested in, and dig into it.",UgxLUyS2BmuSWolDG294AaABAg,1,4,2021-07-31T15:07:35Z,S4Lei5mOppc,user_17

"Came for the papaya, stayed for the wisdom and wizardry! üî•üî• stream Ken, congrats to you and the community! If you haven‚Äôt already definitely read David Goggin‚Äôs book (Can‚Äôt Hurt Me) and Jesse Itzler‚Äôs book where Goggin‚Äôs lives with him for 30 days (Living with a Seal), I read them both and went a little H.A.M off the back of it and did an impromptu 65k ultra marathon last year. 

Also, was taking notes all through the stream, and added some of my thoughts:
1. Yes there are a lot of tools out there particularly stuff that will automate and streamline DS and ML workflows. There are however a TONNN of companies which have barely scratched the surface when it comes to DS having an adept captain at the wheel is going to be the difference between them being successful versus not. (18:24)
2. Advice on self studying data science, just get started with something! 100% hands down the best advice, pick something you‚Äôre interested in and go for it (32:31)
3. Loved the fact that you both called out developing fundamental skills. Having a strong base allows you to move quickly and stay up to date with innovation in the field (51:50), I‚Äôm off to study LDA right now.

a) best way to access data. Many websites gives access to data through API
b) reliable and consistent
c) one of the best ways to make your model useful is to turn it into an API
d) saves us time through reusability (leveraging pre built models)

"Insightful video. I've got smart ho e devices and I do believe Google assistant has the tech to listen in on my conversations, but if I'm getting value out of it, then I tend to just let it be. I'll use/allow certain platforms to have access and not others. We have somewhat of a control over how our info is shared, but it's not right in front of us.

No no I can't continue i am gonna give up"" just because this video??? Why don't you encourage all people to work in this field encourage, motivate them?? , but in fact it is not difficult, it just needs to work hard... 
You're already making videos related to data science, but why would you put someone down when they've found a dream and want make it comes true?? And also make him worry that he might back off and you prove that belief in his head? Also at the beginning of the video you talk about this as if it is impossible for normal people to do

"Thank you for sharing your insights.

I am a working professional in the chemical industry (14 years experience) 
with an applied/pure mathematics degree and am at this point of decision making. I have been accepted into my local accredited university for their Masters of Data Science program. I have also been accepted into GaTech‚Äôs Data Science boot camp, and am currently doing the Google Certification to get some bearings.

I really don‚Äôt want to wait the 3.5 years it would take to get my masters to enter into this field and would rather start into an entry job at least before I work on my degree, but I also don‚Äôt have much of the specific data experience from my current position to get me there.

Do you believe a math degree along with the bootcamp would carry weight? do you know any colleagues that took a similar route? I feel that my math background allows me to be more than capable for the job, but convincing an employer of this without certs or anything else under my belt is a challenge. I am also open to obtaining my Masters while working in data, I‚Äôm all about continuing education.

"Honestly i don‚Äôt know what you are on about... Having worked as a Data Scientist for our government and for the 2nd largest bank of my country (Rabobank) i can say with confidence that a ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù is just a data analist with some data engineering and statistics experience... Mabey not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù but far from impossible.

Second point i like to point out is that you should not want to work as a data scientist the rest of your life. You get paid significantly less for your work than for example working as a financial analist or data consultant/manager.. 

Your career path if you want to not get scammed (at least in my country) should be something along the line of: 
- BSc Business Informatics or Information Science
- Work 1-2 year as an IT consultant or Data Engineer
- MSc in Data Science, Econometrics or Statistics/Mathematics
- Work 1 year as a Data scientist at a decent company
- Switch jobs and work as a Financial Analist, Data Manager or IT manager.

I know umich is kind of a prestigious school, but I got rejected from UCLA, UC Berkeley, NYU, the Ivies, etc. for undergrad. I want to potentially go to one of these schools for my masters in data science. Do you think its a stretch? Umich is way harder than expected, and my CGPA is 3.4 and my major CGPA is 3.06. I feel like my CGPA is way to low to be aiming for these schools so I was wondering what my target schools should be when applying for masters.

"hello, I would really appreciate an advice on choosing between data science and software engineering.
I studied Economics ad University, but it has never been my passion.

After years of academic studies in the field of Economics I started coding for the first time, in Python.
Since then I developed a true passion for programming.

I currently know Python very well as well as Django to a basic level. I have done several projects with these.
During this path I also had the opportunity to learn Data Science/ML basics.

I am really undecided on which career to pursue.

These are the things I like mostly:
- programming, a lot (this would make me think I more suitable for software engineering)
- using Git and Github
- discovering insights, extracting meanings (this sounds more like data science)
- creativity. I feel I am very creative, and not really a math person.
- languages, both computer and human: I love english (I am not english mother tongue)

I find Data Science fascinating and being a data scientist would surely ""make more sense"" given my background compared to being a software engineering. Also, it requires some skills such as clear communication and presentation skills that I feel I have. However, I fear that data science would not value what I think are (or might become) my strongest skills, creativity and programming, and instead would require me to work more on math on a daily basis. I do not think I would enjoy working with math every day.

What helped me was understanding that I will not 100% know and understand everything and that is okay, nobody does:)

Taking small baby steps and learning through 1 project as a time has been a huge success for me & for those trying to learn, I highly recommend the ""Data Science Project By Scratch"" series on Ken's channel!",Ugxtt9WwzYySHIRR7HN4AaABAg,1,3,2021-05-31T12:44:11Z,7JCterBrcvk,user_2763

"Do you think an undergraduate degree in data science is worth doing if its something that interests me? I don't reckon you're too familiar with many uk univerisites (my bad if i am mistaken) but i have an offer to study data science at warwick, and an offer to study computer science at manchester - the main reason i consider the data science degree is because i like the look of it a lot, but if i keep an interest in coding (though the degree has a lot of options for coding modules within it already), that I won't really be doing myself any wrong picking the data science undergrad over the computer science undergrad? My main concern is only that a cs grad may be viewed slightly more preferable in a range of places just by degree name, but i dont know if thats true or not",Ugw6AqPZAPthuSvvZ3V4AaABAg,1,1,2021-05-30T15:29:16Z,4OZip0cgOho,user_5623

"Great content as always. I have a question, maybe it will help others too. 

I'm starting fresh in the DS journey. There's one thing that got me a bit discouraged, and I felt you targeted this issue in one of your videos too:
One of the big reasons I decided to switch to DS is being an International career; I saw myself joining a firm, and later switching jobs, industries, even countries very easily (just like Software Engineers ^^).

However, I sensed that it's not the case with DS? I sensed like if I joined a certain industry as Data Scientist, my skills won't be easily transferable to other industries. For example, you joined the DS world in the sport industry, right? Do you feel your experience is easily transferred to other industries (like automotive, social media, music, retail, etc...). Landing a job in a different company/industry is easy?

Life is a struggle, learning new fields of study is a struggle, but as long as you learn to accept the struggle and push forward regardless, when you zoom out you should get a better picture in how much you‚Äôve accomplished over a course of time.

"i kinda find it cool, but too intense.
I did a bachelors in law, then did a bachelors in business informatics. 
I did so much better in my informatics degree but the it was the most taxing and I would shut down and literally quit school a couple of days after projects and exams. I was quite a slow learner, despite my 3.7 gpa.
Im just looking for a career that pays a lot where the skills required are not so broad.
I feel like accounting could have done the trick.
Im about to do an internship as a data analyst, im honestly still not sure about this path and I dont know many ppl as clueless as I am about their interests, after investing so much time in education. Any advice?",UgxZ0mW9qzU880d-JZt4AaABAg,1,1,2021-05-27T16:44:31Z,3Mm1U1CbzNw,user_3315

"Hey Ken, huge fan of your work. 

I'd like to add that ""data scientist"" is not the only job out there in the ""data field"". You could end up becoming a data engineer, data architect, data analyst, business analyst, systems analyst, software developer, cybersecurity analyst, decisions and operations analytist, etc. 

My point: you could start thinking you want to be a data scientists, but then realize your skill set and interests are better suited for any other of the areas I listed.",Ugz0i4lsFwoN79KySxl4AaABAg,1,5,2021-05-27T14:09:48Z,sHRq-LshG3U,user_201

"Hey Ken -
I'm considering pulling the trigger on investing in 365 Data Science.  It seems comprehensive and very reasonably priced.  A lot of comm colleges I've looked at don't seem offer too many of these types of courses.  While most of them have Calc 1 - III, they seem to be lacking in other areas (like data structures and stats courses beyond elementary stats).  I realize they are only two year programs.  Any insight regarding which CCs might be offering a more Data Science specific majors at some point in the near future?  Would a comp sci program be of any use?
I have been getting a lot out of working through some of these Kaggle projects.  Honestly, just looking through the comments, code, and how previous projects were built are extremely helpful.  (Your Titantic project example is certainly among them).  
I apologize for bombarding you with these long-winded questions.  I do, however, greatly appreciate the insight you pump out via YouTube. 
 As difficult as this material can be, I do find your words and wisdom inspiring.  It's also nice to see occasional rays of light while sifting through all these reams of data, code, algorithms, and math.  It does spark ideas in my ""not-so-mathematically-inclined"" brain.

It's funny you mentioned a lawyer making the transitioned into the field.  Actually, I know a guy who made a virtually identical transition into a CS/DS related field.  Personally, I don't possess that sort of professional esteem.  I've worked a variety of jobs including tennis teaching pro/coach, commercial painting estimator, warehousing, etc.  Unfortunately, I never earned my Bachelor's.  While I came within range and have taken a series of biz-ad courses at a couple of comm colleges, I can't say that a degree is part of my repertoire.  
With all that being said, do you still think investing in a bootcamp would be the way to go?  Would it perhaps be better for someone with my set of circumstances to at least pursue an Associates in Biz with a concentration in D Analytics?

BI seems to be something that might give me an edge in marketing, and in an of itself, it's valued on the market and pays well of the bat.

26ft? You realize if this was the 4point line Steph Curry and Dame Lillard are going to murder the league. Steph is shooting 43.7 percent from 25-29 ft. He is shooting 45.3 percent from 30-35 ft. Dame is shooting 40% from 25-29 ft and 34% from 30-35 ft. Analytically shooting 25% from 4 is equivalant to shooting 50% from 2 point range. If Steph Curry was to shoot 43.7 percent from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 87% from 2 point range. If Dame Lillard is shooting 40% from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 80% from 2 point range. In context Shaq who was one of the most dominant players ever shot a field goal percentage of 58.2%. So unless you can get wide open dunks on almost every trip down the court dealing with a potential 40% 4 point shooter is not something this league is ready for.,UgxbQDyrnR3_3h1N1H94AaABAg,1,0,2021-05-01T18:56:26Z,-kX2b6TF_9k,user_3624

I'm currently a Data Analyst in a social media marketing agency and am looking to do an advanced degree in Data Science. Unfortunately, my non-technical background (I'm a liberal arts major who happens to be good at Math) means that I don't have the prerequisite undergraduate courses needed for Masters degrees in Data Science.

However, I fit the profile of some Masters in Business Analytics/Management Analytics degrees. These courses combine business concepts with coding components, with introductory overviews into ML & AI, but they're not deep, technical specializations. Was wondering if you'd say it would be a relatively smooth journey from a Business Analytics Masters degree to an eventual Data Scientist role?",UgwFwXH-loxMPp6cDEh4AaABAg,2,1,2021-04-23T14:33:11Z,EMq4PH7PCeA,user_3265

"I'd personally recommend watching some free videos on a topic on yt before enrolling in a course. This way you can easier choose a good course because you already know what to look for, and since you already know some basics as you watched that free stuff, the material sinks in better because you are repeating it again while watching the course you chose (plus you get a different angle on the topic). 

As you say and I can confirm (from a PhD perspective) ;) getting more then one point of view is important. People have a bias and some things are obvious for one person while difficult for another, the choice of words is very important too. 

Mine main problem is I like theory too much plus I tend to start too many topics at once. I get too impatient and can start NLP topics even though I should be doing e.g. clustering, and NLP is not on the plan for the next few months at least. This has some advantages too (not only bad sides!) - when I get to NLP it's not all new and sinks in better, but me doing that makes the whole process chaotic. Well, I try to pat myself on the back that - in the end - if I fill all the knowledge gaps - it's not that important in what order I did it... 

Still I know I need more order and systematic approach. And more practice. 

Other issue with learning DS, or every new thing really, is that you don't know how long it will take you (coz it's new to you and you don't know it so how can you plan how long it will take if you don't even know what are all the things you must learn... if it makes any sense). So - yeah, don't get crazy about deadlines, just focus on the progress.

Another pro-tip - browse job offers to see what the companies want. I think this may be area and industry specific - in my area they want people good with databases, Hadoop, Spark and other Big data associated things more then they want Deep Learning & AI specialists. 

Kinda makes sense when you think of it... So for me, on my road to Data Science, I decided to go back to my analytics job that will let me practice python&SQL more, get my bills payed ;) and practice the DS stuff in my free time (coz I can already see with the Big data things and me still needing to work on my DL skills more this can easily take another 6 months...) 

So yeah, some comments on Data Science learning from someone who has been learning it for about 6 months ;)",UgwV5kiOvuMLDk6PM6p4AaABAg,2,2,2021-04-23T14:19:49Z,hOUrxTeBJQc,user_5252

1) It's been some time since I completed MySQL course. However i have gone through the videos a few times but still I am not able to gain the confidence of saying that I know SQL.  What do you suggest here? 
2) Practical knowledge is very important and I am unable to get that. I have a dataset. I make up problem statements in my mind and try solving it. But that is clearly not helping at all. So can you suggest me some places where I can apply the knowledge of Sql that I gained through the course?

What I found was offering some type of value to the person was best to gain traction and also have a better feeling myself knowing that I wasn't just using this new person as a resource only.

"Just a couple of comments on this excellent video:

For Challenge 4: Actually I'd said find the COMPANIES you'd like to go in order to decide what you want to learn. Try to learn as much as you can from them, and not just their recruitment process. Now, I have yet to find a data science job but I've been around in the job hunting department. There's nothing that puts off an employer more than someone in an interview knowing nothing about the company (I've been there!) ... the reverse is also true, there's nothing more compelling for a prospective employer than an canditate who not just put out the work on their skills but on knowing the company (i've been there too!). It show commitment and the right kind too!

As for the continued learning part, I've learned (duh!) that it something that you need to do constantly for a good life anyways ... no matter what job or hobby you like to do. I probably cited the following quotes a 1000 times in my entourage and probably here too but listen (possibly again):

""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but an habit!"". You'll find out that this quote holds true not just for data science but also ... anything really in life really. 

It is also why challenge like #66daysofdata are valuable ... and not just for you professional career but, again ... for anything you want to do really. 

There is a metric tons of things to say about habit formation and, again, I still stand by the methods of stephen guise (which really work well!), but the gist of it is actually quite simple:

work on making your habit sustainable long term before trying to put in massive loads of work. if you do the latter, chances are high you'll burn out (fast!). Do the former, and your brain and body will slowly adjust and adapt to that new habit you're trying to form. 

PS: The variance is quite around the 66 mean to form a new habit. Some can take almost 215 days to form and others can take hold in as little as 12 days!!  (I've been there on both front!) 
But, as they say, your mileage may vary!! 

Safe journey and good luck everyone :o)",UgwG9zapYEaJeXUzncZ4AaABAg,2,1,2021-04-09T21:10:33Z,sHRq-LshG3U,user_1105
"Thank you for the great video as always Ken. The grit aspect towards the end really speaks to me as someone trying to enter into the field. I remembered when I first started out going into this field my first year at UC Davis, I felt a major hit of imposter syndrome. It all really started out with when I interviewed for a Data Science project for the Data Science club at UC Davis. The president at the time (who interviewed me) asked questions about my project experience, interest in sports (this was a sports analytics project that required computer vision to analyze the movements of players), last book I read, project experience, and my SAT math score. As I answered those questions, he didn't like many answers to any of them (never had projects because I just learned how to code from my Introductory Python course I took the quarter before the interview, not into sports, stupidly said the last book I read was ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" even though it was a book about Robert Kennedy (I was kind of nervous here), and I scored in the 600 range for math) and proceeded to say this, ""Look Jeffrey, I know there's way smarter people than you. Tell me, what makes you stand out?"" My response was, ""Uh... I'm willing to work,"" and he said, ""*sigh* Everyone's willing to work."" I basically failed the interview and he basically implied that this field isn't for me (to add insult to injury, I saw someone do better than me at the interview right after I finished). Not only that, some people thought that I would end up at McDonald's after I graduated. To compensate, I did side projects throughout sophomore year, got accepted into Facebook's Data Science mentorship called the Facebook Data Challenge 2020, secured a summer internship as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, got accepted into the MURPPS Research Program at UC Davis, and I'm on my way to prepare for an interview for a Bioinformatics Research Position in the Molecular and Cell Biology department at UC Davis to use machine learning models to predict the structure of DNA/RNA to determine how this can lead toward genetic diseases. I'm glad that having developed a sense of grit throughout the years has been so far useful for not only proving people wrong, but also giving me great opportunities.",UgzFBzll6MEApYk5X5Z4AaABAg,4,11,2021-04-09T21:04:52Z,sHRq-LshG3U,user_2088

"Great advice, Ken. As someone trying to break into the field from a MS Math, I agree the entry level market is oversaturated, though a lot of candidates are unqualified. MSDS programs (which seem to dictate which skills are ""trending"") put emphasis on data viz & ML in Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) but from what I've seen in job postings, very few data roles use these. Outside of FAANG, where ML operations are critical, most companies need analysts (SQL, Tableau) or SWEs to build pipelines. Creating Jupyter notebooks and applying scikit-learn is a very narrow, high-supply-low-demand skillset. There is a 2020 MIT article suggesting 1 in 10 companies benefited from ML efforts. 

I think it's important to learn skills that are trending once you're in the field, but until then it's better to learn skills that are in high demand (SQL, Tableau, cloud services).  This is what I'm dedicating my time to now.",UgykpuO6YFPCmRWboCh4AaABAg,4,7,2021-04-09T17:31:43Z,sHRq-LshG3U,user_4686

"Hello, I am struggling to choose a major. I have attained my associate of science transfer degree and need to choose a major. I think I am interested in an information science and data analysis program, but the requirements say you must already have a previous ""skill set"" with python, java, oracle, and linux, or similar to each of those. I am a first gen college student so I am extremely unfamiliar with everything basically. The counselors don't provide any helpful info about specific majors. So, can you tell me, am I supposed to study these on my own, and then apply? Do most people learn on their own, and then apply for majors involving them? I was always under the impression that most people take college courses/gain credits for these but apparently it's wrong? Isn't college for finding what you enjoy too? How would I ever know if I like data analyses and python if I've never taken an actual class on it?

As you used to play Gold and Baseball and you have more knowledge about Basketball. I am a guy who played mostly Cricket from my childhood and some sports which I sometimes play and watch are badminton, hockey, car, and bike racing.

So Which is a better choice for a person like me. Should I try to apply my skills in games like baseball or Basketball or is it better to go ahead with the games which I played till now?

"#64: I never had the chance to have time on Fridays or Saturdays for 66 Days of Data, today was my lucky day!
I do like the one that gives insights to make decisions or help the athletes to improve performance.
In the past was difficult to keep track of how an athlete was responding to the training loads, how was sleeping, how was recovering with all the variables that differ from gender to position in the game (or sport). 
It's fascinating to see how some products and the Data Science applied have helped organizations, coaches, and athletes to find the invisible reasons for bad performance or injury :)

"I believe we usually tend to choose an optimal strategy based on our present situation, whose benefits are only seen on the long term. For example in Morocco, I have to get a Master's Degree, but online courses, assignments and exams take all my time and energy .. Yet I can't just decide to study DS at home and not pursue a Master's Degree because I won't qualify for most job offers. At the same time, pursuing Economic Analysis and Modelling is what introduced me to DS .. Although studying free a home would have saved me so much time, money and effort, I'm not sure I'd follow that path if I wasn't already formally stuyding ..

"Hello Ken, Thanks for uploading this helpful series. It is really helping me understand the basics very well! :) 



I had a question about data collection. Is data collection supposed to be a one-time process or does it have to be repeated over when the data in the source has changed? Taking the example of glassdoor, the data around salary will change over time, so how do we decide how often we should re-collect the data? And what if the website structure changes so often and hinders the scraping process? For example, this data scrapper code we referenced doesn't work very well if I run it now as many locators have changed, so I would also have to keep up with the changes in the glassdoor web structure.

"#48: Ok, you love golf.
And, this is what I meant with the Basketball video. It's much better to understand the idea (Not a Golf fan here he he) 
About the factors, you read them in a book, or was it because of your expertise in Golf? (Not being an average golfer,  course conditions)
Great analysis!!!!!

"Hello!

I am a big fan of your channel and your content helps me learn data science and ML

I am a tennis player and I was thinking on how I could apply data analytics to my game. I did some research and I found a startup called SwingVision that analyses your game using AI.

I thought that I could do something similar mixing my passion of tennis and AI. I have been doing some research but I am not aware of any tool that allows me to do something similar to that. I found some research papers but they had too much math and they were too complex to build my app from that. Are you aware of some framework or any tool that allows me to do something like that? Or do you think that I need to make new algorithms? Also, do you have any tips on how to make it a profitable Saas?

Thank you, ‚ò∫Ô∏è

"I noticed you talked about how a data science major is more watered down than a DS masters, and how majoring in one area of DS could be better. 
I‚Äôm currently choosing between majoring in CS at Penn State or data science at Purdue. Do you think the name recognition and internship opportunities at Purdue could outweigh the potential drawbacks, or should I just stick to CS at a less impressive school?

Also, the data science program at Purdue is relatively new, and students say many of the classes are similar to those a CS major takes. The main difference is that CS majors learn software engineering while DS majors learn statistics and data analysis.

Another example could be year over year SG stats at the same tournament held at the same course. How are course conditions and weather factored into a players SG score. 

Essentially what I am after is this, are strokes gained calculated in isolation within the same round, tournament, PGA tour Season, or every PGA golf shot ever taken?",UgzAJxiYaHWAV9TL04B4AaABAg,7,1,2021-02-20T04:00:43Z,3cDM9Z-fdz4,user_3857

"These are pretty solid tips.  I went through a similar journey since I'm already working and need structured learning. In 2017, I looked at MS CS and MS Data Science programs under $20K that are still decent. What I've seen is Georgia Tech OMSCS ($8,000), Illinois University MS Data science ($21,000), and Indiana University MS Data Science ($21,000).  I failed with my application to Illinois.  I got into OMSCS, I failed my 1st 2 classes and, projected to stay here for a long time. The average class students take is around 1.2 subjects/sem, with a failure rate of about 45%.  I'm finishing up my IU MS Data Science, and hard to find a job still.  What I got is Data Visualization and Management at Ernst and Young (and a lot of my cohorts are still struggling to find work, but easy to get an internship).  If you get into Ga tech OMSCS, it's easier to find job.  OMSCS is data science heavy degree. Subjects include ML, AI, HCI, Computer Vision, ML for Trading, etc.  We even have AI TA's with top-notch teachers and cohorts.",UgwaB8TEfrQ-913hAt14AaABAg,1,2,2021-02-15T01:15:32Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_3669

"I started learning data science due to the hype created in the market. I forced myself to take interest cuz everyone was doing it. I watched a lot of tutorial, read blogs, made account on kaggle, read research paper on GAN, open ai and list goes on. But still somewhere all this wasn't much appealing and interesting as it was appearing before entering into it. I realized I was not very interested in statistics and probability. And these are the prerequisites to get into this field. So I tried software engineering and got into web development. Today I find it more interesting that data science and I really enjoy the process of building new project and coming up with ur own idea. Unlike data science where u have to spend hours cleaning data and training models. So I recommend everyone to give a try to every field out there, don't follow the herd mentality and explore it, read about it and then decide what's suits you and stick to it.",UgzCcbu8PIgCe3i6qht4AaABAg,10,91,2021-02-15T00:51:39Z,SVtRsDhHlDk,user_5631

In big five scale in my opinion you're high in openess, low in agreableness, high in concienciousness and probably more introverted. In MBTI scale it would be INTJ type.

"Hi. Thanks for your review, but it seems like unfair to compare Apple üçé to orange . Where python is general language with general purpose , unlike R which is a niche programming language otherwise a statistical mathematical language. R is specific that what makes it better than any other language while dealing with analysis. Also R is faster while dealing with large data,  the more the data is big the more is faster. Unlike python which get slower with larger data.

Also the number of contributions and packages is far bigger than python if we compare them in the niche of data science statistics etc..

Visualisation same things while R is the market standard for official productions, I think there is #rstats on Twitter where folks publish there artistic visualisations, also I guess the (TidyTuesday) contest where community provides weekly data for challenges and contributions. 

Machine learning,  users can use R as interface to Tensorflow/keras and pytoch and more, also, a tones of ml packages comes a long to perform complex models.

If you are a developer dealing sometimes with data I suggest you to stay with python . Otherwise data analysts and researchers should pick-up R and stick to it. 

Every language is important,  know what you need to achieve first.  Than choose what is most comprehensive language that will fulfill  ur need and don't rush yourself much.",UgySO2bkiuLqQL-LAvh4AaABAg,1,1,2021-02-05T20:04:45Z,AxP1CL0yaFQ,user_5005

I am at the intermediate level in Data Science and have done a couple of projects and have become quite comfortable tackling beginner/intermediate problems, however I feel that my coding skills are very limited to DS, do you think I should learn new skills (ex; web development), or do you think sticking to DS related coding is enough to get me into the industry? My second question is how deep into the math behind the ML algorithms should I go and understand, especially when it comes to more complicated models (and deep learning models). If my goal is to become a business oriented data scientist (and maybe a sports analyst), Is a basic understanding of the math behind models enough ?

"The iris dataset is ideally suited for regression, classification, and clustering projects for beginners. Working with a single dataset and learning which types of machine learning algorithms are possible and appropriate can reduce the time before you can tackle resume-worthy projects.

"The last question could be understood as if you were fishing for feedback, hence might indicate lack of confidence or even a lack of understanding to the position you are interviewing for. After all, you have supposedly done your homework and established a strong link between your knowledge, set of skills and the open position, the company's vision, goals, etc. In other words, how would you add value to the company if you still do not understand how your skills and expertise align with their expectations?

"Hi Ken, 

Thanks so much for your videos; I find them really encouraging and instructive.

I am wondering, how does the intuition we build about the data inform how we set up the models?
If feels like there was a bit of a disconnect there, and right now if feels like I just turn on these black box
models and get a prediction with little understanding of the variables ...

Thanks!",UgzMGChDed8lnnwCw4p4AaABAg,2,1,2021-01-19T20:14:57Z,I3FBJdiExcg,user_2222
"Hi Ken, I am regularly watching your channel now and thanks for lots of great videos. I have recently declared double major on DS. And, my  current fear is that I have encountered lots of data scientists saying that ds requires solid understanding in math. I have already took Calc 1 and 2. However, it was a while ago, so i believe i need to restudy them. And, I still need to take a stats course and linear algebra. So, im currently wondering how strong of math do I need to know if I want to go into the field? Or, how in depth do i need to know of math? For ex, would I need just basic understanding of calculus, stats and linear algebra. Or, do I need to know them solidly by knowing good enough to take ‚Äúhonors‚Äù or ‚Äúhigher‚Äù courses in that I can implement them however I want and solve bunch of Olympiad level questions? 

Also, would it be okay for me to learn math through online courses or books to acquire skills, or do I need to take courses from a college in order to show that I have taken courses? 


Thank you as always and rly hope that you can give me some insights on these.",UgwlT1QI_7Zbs7wd4WR4AaABAg,1,1,2021-01-19T19:17:16Z,3Mm1U1CbzNw,user_33

I'm studying online courses with 365 data now, but what would be my next step? Thank you so very much!!",UgwMbmHepfUq5TF28GN4AaABAg,4,3,2021-01-14T16:35:17Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_1023

I think it is incredibly valuable to see your approach to learning a new Python package - especially to those new to the field that are struggling with imposter syndrome.  Googling and seeing how other people have tackled a problem/project you are working on (and even using some of their code) is perfectly fine and in lots of cases probably the most efficient way of learning a new data analysis method/skill/etc.

"Thank yoy for the very informative videos.
I would add the following advice, which I wish someone had told me: while following courses or reading books in the Data Science learning process, we will be doing tiny projects. There will be a tendency to focus on the learning and not on the packaging of one's work. By packaging I mean: cleaning your code, properly commenting it, basically making it into a notebook you could publish, not into a code that just does the job.

So, there is a tendency to produce drafts for these projects in the learning process, instead of final versions. And the assumption is that at that moment learing is the goal, and that at some later moment we will convert these into final portfolio projects, when we have more time that we can spare and dedicate to the cosmetics part. 

But then you end up a few of months later with a lot of small project drafts to finalize and the task of refactoring and documenting so many projects will seem daunting and you'll keep postponing it. 

Therefore, my advice is: dedicate some time during this learning process to finalizing and publishing your work, resist the temptation of pushing this task further into the future. There won't be a 'right' time.",UgxZtoGdbi8FUB8YBtF4AaABAg,1,2,2021-01-09T15:07:54Z,yukdXV9LR48,user_2909

Generally, going from fewer skills to more skills is desirable, but going from ""fat"" aka something negative to ""skinny"" aka an admirable goal...just isn't universal, and it can be unhelpful to present it as such. A more constructive way to present this example could be about taking care of one's health, whatever that looks like for different people.

"Hello Ken! Thanks for the content!

I recently moved from Brazil to Saint Charles (about 1h from Chicago) so as to stay with my wife and thought that pursuing a masters, instead of only self learning, could give me an edge when looking for a job here. I graduated in Industrial Engineering and am pursuing a masters in data science, preferably in the Chicago area.

Is pursuing a masters a good idea given that I do not currently have a diploma that local employers would recognize?
How much does the prestige of the university matter for professional outcome?
What is, in your opinion, best for professional outcome? An online but more prestigious degree or an on site but less prestigious degree? In Brazil there is prejudice against online learning.
What are your thoughts on University of Illinois at Chicago and Illinois Institute of Technology in general, but also regarding their Business Analytics and Data Science masters ?
Given that I have what I believe could be considered a ""technical background"" what do you believe would be important in a masters in data science? Hard or soft skills?
How was your experience at DePaul? Quality of classes and professional outcome wise.

"Reviewing the processing code that others have written has exposed a significant issue. Whether the original dataset is already in a ""sanitized"" state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing ""notebooks"" show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data?


Perhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is  a model necessary? 


The curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc.

Think critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us. Ask the difficult questions and attempt to answer them.",Ugw5pWtNBiaVcQokThV4AaABAg,0,1,2021-01-01T11:43:07Z,-pdXWmj9xxU,user_1704

"Hey ken , I am a 3rd year computer science undergraduate student. And over these years i have taught my self some of the foundations of Data Science. And I was thinking of doing  a masters in data science . But i checked the syllabus of most of the data science Masters and i found out that i have the foundations of most of those courses. So i was thinking if it's the right masters for me?
I'm also keeping an option to do Masters in AI. Since most of data science and AI courses are same . But i think that AI is more Advanced. So please can you guide me?",UgzhkSW_JLR7oTIoAT54AaABAg,1,1,2021-01-01T05:20:32Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_4046

"Hi Ken. I just opened up my course work for my master's program in Data Science from the University of Denver and I am on red alert! The bridge math courses are so intense that I feel like I may be in over my head. The calculus bridge course essentially covers calculus from limits all the way up to multivariate calculus and beyond (4 to 5 calculus courses) in a span of 10 weeks! Their discrete math and linear algebra combine these two disciplines as well. I may switch to Eastern University's program which is much less math intensive and can be completed in 10 months. Do you think companies will really care where I get my degree from? I enjoy math, but not at such a pace that I will have difficulty retaining any of it. The fact that I end up spending over 95% of my time using outside resources to even begin to understand how to do the homework assignments leads me to believe this may not be a very well structured program and that I might as well drop this master's program and switch to a different one.",Ugz6yfy1BjJ_em_oADx4AaABAg,1,1,2020-12-29T18:23:59Z,41Clrh6nv1s,user_1243
"I'm interested in shifting my career to ""Data Science"" & I need an advice from an expert in the field after watching good amount of your Youtube videos.


I moved to Illinois, Chicago 7 months ago from Jordan. I've been in the Marketing field for over 5 years & I decided this isn't the field that I wish to continue perusing.

Since a lot of companies require Master's degree as a minimum requirement for a Data Scientist position. I conducted MSc programs search that would have low entry requirements considering that I come from Business major, and  I came across ""Eastern University"" Data Science Accelerated (7 Weeks) Online MSc, which I applied to & waiting a response from the admission office.

I compared the curriculum to other universities, & I noticed that Cloud Computing & Algorithms are not covered.

My Question:
If I proceed with this low entry barrier University (If Accepted) considering my lack of technical knowledge coming from a Business Major (Learning Python & SQL on my own)
- Will I be able to land a job after finishing the program? since the university isn't well recognized or hiring relies on sharpened skills?
- Does the curriculum cover the needed practical knowledge on the job?
- What are the areas/topics that you see important and are not listed in the curriculum?

Below are the information of the program, if you could spare 15 minutes of your time to give me a candid opinion.

"I was facing an issue while scrapping.

Search as per keywords was not happening.

To tackle that I had to add the following code just below the ""#clicking to the X."" try block.

Code :- 
        try:
            driver.find_element_by_id('HeroSearchButton').click()
        except NoSuchElementException:

"Before delving into machine learning I recommend aspiring data scientists hone data cleaning and exploratory data analysis skills. Data familiarization and cleaning being foundational skills. There are smallish datasets that are appropriate for beginners and which can be visually scanned to confirm the findings reported. For example, the automobile fuel efficiency dataset available from UCI contains 'marked' missing values for some numeric data, data entry mistakes primarily in the make and/or model; not every make and model combination is present more than one year, and two fuel types are present. The data source makes available the original dataset as well as a subset still requiring further cleaning, along with a codebook describing the data and each variable. Many instructors tell you to begin by plotting the data but this approach has two problems: you do not know if there are any missing values or other incorrect values which can lead to plots which are erroneous or simply cannot be rendered; and you have not spent sufficient time understanding the raw data and the types of questions it might be able to answer.",UgxKyDHnDOyoUacXvxd4AaABAg,2,44,2020-12-22T23:47:35Z,8igH8qZafpo,user_1704

"A current master here: 30% comes from the uni as a big index along the courses you have and demanding you to pass the exams. 70% from really learning from other sources online.

Rankings are just marketing and must be ignored, look from pros and cons from the uni and the location to avoid surprises (especially as an international), get money from wherever you can as you will have enough stress from learning, and prepare in advance to reduce that 70% to save time and enjoy the journey.",UgwQBYErFf2KvdeGq5l4AaABAg,1,1,2020-12-22T03:06:06Z,ji7DtgUeKCI,user_1651

"Took me a while to write the comment, sorry. I've been busy with Christmas preparations (sending virtual Polish Christmas pierogi to Hawaii ;) ). 

My new year's resolutions are a bit similar - I want to get more engaged in communities and find new friends. Also - maybe eventually appear on your YT Channel as a successful transition to DS story ;) 

I have many ideas for DS projects, but they all need some more research (some including IP & compliance research - hey, I used to work as something like a ISO/FDA compliance officer for a while, I kinda like this stuff? I certainly don't mind it... I found some courses on Coursera about those topics... I am not ruling out taking those courses in 2021. Engineers that are willing to get involved with those topics are rare, so familiarity with such issues can be very valuable to employer... it is just an idea at this point, no decisions have been made). 

I also need to take some deep dive on deep learning and some machine learning algorithms. I ABSOLUTELY need to browse & learn from other people's DS projects more. It's very inspiring too ;)

"Sorry but your definition is totally misleading because Artificial Intelligence is not a field of data science neither machine learning but machine learning is a subset of AI and AI is a subset Computer Science. It has been so since 1956 and has never changed. People who develop AI algorithms are computer scientists not data scientists. 

Just like Mathematics is not a subset of Physics, yes Data Scientists use lot of ML to solve problems but they do not generally study AI like computer scientist do. Just like physicists uses math but they do not study math like mathematicians do. You can also say so about medical professionals when comparing them to biologists.

I really have been absorbing and enjoying your videos for the past 3 months. Having a physics background and a secret fear of programming, your clear philosophical approach has been a lifesaver. 
I thoroughly enjoy the weekly interviews on KNN and the separate, visual content your youtube channel has to offer. It's so cool to track your growth!

"Great advice and content Ken! One thing I would love to add to those seeking their first job is to ignore job titles, and be open to positions such as ""BI Analyst/Engineer, Data Analyst, etc"", especially if you are entry level for several reasons  1) I was a BI associate and had opportunities to work on ML. Companies use terms interchangeably, and I have seen ""data scientists"" who do SQL and reporting all day.. 2)  If you want to be a data scientist, you'll have to work with analysts, BI people, data engineers, and stepping into their shoes will help you in the long run. In a way it's taking 1 step back to take 3 forward.  and 3) People should really focus on bringing value to an organization, rather than just doing ""cool"" projects. A lot of companies aren't ready for advanced ML/AI. You will be more miserable creating a data science project which will never be put into production than creating a Tableau Dashboard that the whole business will use.

"you said and i agree :first start with learn programming
at what point do u stop and say ok i ''''know''''' programming ?
so for me i decided that when i am able to solve 6 kyu question on codewars and easy questions on leetcode without any problem and only then can i say without feeling that i lie that kind of know enough python to go on
granted it takes a lot of time and pain but im pretty sure it will be worth it because then i can be sure that comes hell or high water i will never have a problem that is caused bcoz of insufficient knowledge in programming

"There is so much free and good source out there about data science and so many ways to learn it... As someone just starting their data science journey and someone who is struggling with ADHD I was so overwhelmed and confused. If anyone is in my situation I've found ""Siraj Raval - Learn Data Science in 3 Months"" video helpful. You are not going to be a data scientist in 3 months obviously, but I think it is giving you a rough plan. It is divided into weeks and each month you do one project. Of course, I also check the resources Ken suggested and I am following a Python course on Udemy, so it is ok to mix all of the advice you see. One more advice:  you can better learn a subject when you teach it. So I recommend you start a blog about your DS journey. You can take 10 mins each day and write about what you learned that day. It is also good for you to see how much you've learned over time :) Good luck everyone!",UgwwvMt3BNvxmQjDEKB4AaABAg,1,1,2020-12-19T14:41:37Z,41Clrh6nv1s,user_5255

"When you say probability theory, what level are we talking about? Like the ""probability theory"" class at my school is calculus based and requires us to have taken Multivariable calculus beforehand. Meanwhile I know a lot of concepts in probability theory can be taught to some extent without difficult calculus problems. For example, I just recently ordered a textbook: Probability for the enthusiastic beginner by David J. Morin. It doesn't assume any prior experience with calculus. It covers Combinatorics, Probability, Expectation Values, Distributions, Gaussian Approximations, Correlation, and Regression. Does this sound sufficient?",UgzIO61TqOAGcBU683V4AaABAg,1,1,2020-12-10T09:47:30Z,zSwM5uVeylU,user_4345

"I strongly agree with you about the three rasons in order to not become in a data scientist but I think as you told, depends on your position or your goal. For instance, I think in the resarch area you have less collaboration because most time you are the only one that know your work or your novel investigation so it's sometimes hard to display this to others.  I think there are many resources for learning data science hence the main problem to become in data scientist is the patience and self-confidence.",UgySTZf6PmOkK3_6Mjt4AaABAg,1,1,2020-12-08T18:39:12Z,m5pwx3hgtzM,user_4088

Side comment you made that I find really interesting. That the education was similar everywhere you went but the students were all different.

In case it's helpful for anyone: I'm in Oregon State University's Data Analysis Program and was doing Sales (groan) before. You can either cash out halfway through for a Certificate (for about $12k) or go full Master's (for about $25k). I'm about halfway through. I tried the Udemy and self-learning approach and an actual school is totally worth the money in my eyes. The use cases you work with are more compelling and rigorously assessed than free / cheap stuff I found online. You're also bombarded with concepts each week which gives you a lot of bang for your buck; usually I learn just enough to pass the class then really try to internalize it via independent projects after. I'm planning on a more portfolio-based entryway into a position that recoups what I paid for school and whether my anecdotal advice is even worth listening to probably hinges on how successful that ends up being ;o) but thus far I have been very happy with academic learning (and I'm not someone who likes college!),Ugxrup3_8rICjHToWjF4AaABAg,1,3,2020-12-06T01:26:25Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_1888

What did you do for the glassdoor project (data scraping wise) if you don't mind me asking? If I understand things correctly, if the robots.txt forbids you from scraping them, you use their API and all is cool? 

How is it with using youtube data for data science projects? I'm not talking about downloading videos - I'm interested in comments, video titles and thumbnails. Intuitively it should be ok to use those...

Great content as usual
May I have some recommendations or suggestions from you?
I'm in my graduate study on modeling fish population dynamics. The situation is that I know about one field, working with data and models in this particular area but I wanna make myself a bit more employable post graduation. Therefore, I start looking up about data science, and realize there are some part of data science work I already do (I just don't know it's called data science out there lol). However, there are some part I haven't touched yet (e.g. computer vision, random forest, and neural network). 
Should I do machine learning and deep learning courses to organize my knowledge? 
I deeply understand that nobody can cover all the topics. It's just not happening. What I expect is to be well-prepared for job.

"I started keeping a journal (handwritten) of various functions and methods that I knew I would want to use again.  The journal is long, but it made for quick reference when I encounter a problem that I know I‚Äôve solved before.  

I think the feeling of inadequacy comes from often seeing the finished work of very experienced people and never seeing the process.  It almost makes it look like they can do it all in one go without referencing anything.",UgwrLKkySVyDcFZYlXJ4AaABAg,1,1,2020-11-20T14:41:44Z,XGBigjVy2Eo,user_5545
"This is a good video. Tina's advice/input on course-based masters was definitely useful. I wish I knew about that going into my master's program. I'm doing research now that my professor plans to get published, but it took a lot of work to get to this spot. I don't know of any other master's student in my program doing research. Tina's right that generally, those opportunities are only available for undergrads and PhD students. I want to do an independent study in reinforcement learning to close out my last semester (next semester) but I already know that since I'm not a PhD student or curious undergrad, the chances of me getting that opportunity are slim to none. I'm hopeful that instead I might just continue to do research under the professor I'm currently working with. Course based masters definitely can be good, but it's also good to be aware of the possible cons that they can come with, and I think this video does a good job of explaining those pros and cons.

"Hi Ken, while watching this video, I just realized that I'm now part of one data science community. Wow, thank you for bringing us all together! I'm looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects. 

Lately, I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook, TOC2, which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings. Its link: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html. Once you try it, I bet you will love it.

However, it's not available in Kaggle yet. The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode. There's large room for improvement.

Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago (https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/153519), but received little attention. What a pity! Can you help draw more attention and upvote it? If you have any other ideas, please let me know. I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community.

"I joined the initiative and lasted maybe 10 days... This year has been really rough, but I've always had a problem finding the motivation to self-teach. My personal lesson that I learned was to take the ""5 mins a day"" to heart. My flawed plan at the beginning was to spend 2-3 hours everyday watching recordings of a bootcamp course I took to refresh my memory on coding, then dive into projects. I got burnt out super fast, and part of that was because I wanted to match the impressive strides I saw so many people making on Discord. I'll definitely pace myself better next time and not be stingy and actually buy an online course. And I'll definitely be looking forward to joining in at the beginning of next year for the next initiative, with all of these improvements in mind!",UgxI1kdgPP4ijOWmaYJ4AaABAg,1,2,2020-11-13T15:46:23Z,4039x4r-hGE,user_5177

"Oh man! What an excellent and beautiful video! I have learned so much these past few months, become so much better, it blows my mind. And it wasn't just Machine learning either. That being said, being part of the #66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this, so many thanks for the opportunity ! :)

And one thing that I found that helps for ... practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the ""Silent Flute"".
The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it. It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine. And despite showing its old age,  it's full of wisdoms! 

One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine, playing the master who, according to his student, ""seemed to know everything"" he simply answered with this:

""Every time the sun rises, like the student on their first day of school, I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day."" ... After which, I wrote this on a blank page and added ""... and have an actual, real blank page ready to write the lesson on it.""

I started this on the 14th of may and ... well ... still doing this every-single-day. It's incredible how much you can learn about ... everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there. Like, say, pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life. 

Or use lessons I learned from something else, say art, and apply them to my Machine Learning studies -> The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different. not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but, even better, for all you know, the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one. 

Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it. This post is already getting very long as it is, sorry for the wall of text.  ( come to think of it, I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly).

"You're really starting to get the hang of this YouTube(r) business down! The editing is looking great with the different camera angles and transitions and stuff. Have you considered streaming on Twitch or YouTube for some extra views/content? Resume reviews, portfolio reviews, interview advice/practice, teaching something, etc? I know you put out that course a while ago. Good content in the video by the way. I've been using Kaggle to learn some proper ML techniques and their implementations along with when/how to use them,  and also get acquainted with Python more since I'm an such an R junkie. Playing with some stock data sets on there has been good for me, but I do agree, value or good business value comes from gathering some original data or doing something with some impact. 

I'm currently thinking about trying to build a special app/thingy (currently thinking an RShiny web app) that scrapes data/information on Yugioh's card collecting/valuation website and then so someone can enter what cards they have and how much (ignoring PSA value) and then it'll autopopulate the current valuation cell next to it or something. One small note, and I hope this doesn't come across as offensive, but I personally thought that the camera angle/cutaway/transition at around @6:45 was a bit awkward, as it looked like you were speaking but there was an audio lag or something. Very well could just be something due to my internet, but it took me out a little bit if you know what I mean. Nonetheless though, great video and great content.

"In my opinion, you should stick to the field you are interested in. And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing, not like two columns. But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far. I either have the idea, but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data, but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting. Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project. For instance, I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis, I just love reading about cars, comparing them. But the tricky thing is, there are like 5 or 6 variables to utilize, like mileage, color, horsepower, year produced etc. It's more than enough for eda, but there is not much room for machine learning project. The only interesting idea I came up with (apart fromobvious linear regression) is to analyze, whether mileage is real or not based on the price, number of owners etc. It seems like some fields are inferior in terms of generating data, than others",Ugwec0TyabkXgwV1e7F4AaABAg,1,1,2020-11-06T16:12:31Z,yUrrf3Pm33s,user_5822

He would then move on to the B.A. in  C.S. and finish that degree. One is longer and a Public University the other is Private, but I belive  he can obtain what he needs in Maryville.

"My goal is to create a chatbot for my coaching business that will kick off on Udemy by next April. I just completed a month long Python boot camp and can now begin the real conversation design. My roadmap is in a paper I presented last September in Durban, SA - just as motivation to keep me at it. I‚Äôm a cybersecurity analyst and acquired my master‚Äôs degree in Linguistics at UGA in 2017. I guess I‚Äôm saying  all this to force myself to stay on track and change careers to machine learning. No one around me (including hubby, kids or friends) is interested in machine learning enough to make this their second (non-paying) job, the way I have üëÄ-> as of now.

"Hi, great video, some tips for the reader from what I learned from work: 
1. I recommend to start including git in every project you do, I didn‚Äôt do that, but I wish i did. It helps like ken said with version control, and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process, and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice.
2. He‚Äôs using GitBash, idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but that‚Äôs the command line interface to use git. It‚Äôs also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux/Ubuntu it‚Äôs be easier to use. I use the same but there are others if you don‚Äôt want to start with a command line like VsCode, Atom, GitHub Desktop (although I recommend Bash). 
3. use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch, and want to switch to another one, all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first. 
(Git Stash is just what it sounds like, temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later).",UgwTSYNgmCTE_t0h9yx4AaABAg,1,2,2020-10-24T12:45:53Z,_0rHU6qAQe0,user_3664

"""We fail more then we success""  - so Data Science is like real Science... In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels. Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard. Really hard. And depressing. Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go. ;) 

I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a ""real scientist"" (the one that does experiments in a lab coat, in a lab to discover and create new things). A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless, nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it, results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all.

One of my friends also has imposter syndrome (I have different issues ;) I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems; also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome)...

As for failures - this is a normal part of the process. I don't remember who said it, but it went like this: when you enter the a new uncharted territory, when you try new things nobody did before, everybody is underqualified for the job. I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is - you try to do new things, and you fail, and you learn from it and you try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Some problems can't get solved at this stage - maybe new tools, theories, new data need to appear first. Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution, maybe an approximation can be good enough? I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks - because it requires certain way of thinking, intelligence and skills to solve problems. To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general. Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed. And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad, unproductive way, but that's an off-topic.

The job hunt - IMO it is a bit of lottery. And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves. I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top 25, one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group... and they were not living up to the standard I imagined. The best Scientists I worked with came from UK (university outside the country's top 10) and India. Of course good credentials do help you to get a job. That's why you should get them. But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject. A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD, it does not make someone a good Scientist. Maybe it should, but these are two different things.

I also heard words of wisdom that went like these: don't compare yourself to other people, you don't know their full story. Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today.

I'm off with that - this comment is getting too long. Good video Ken :)",UgwM0jjh6kHvyYrF7bh4AaABAg,2,4,2020-10-16T19:53:58Z,Uf0dO-pgOrk,user_5252

letterly this is what I feel almost in every competitive environment I engage in. Some times I have objective evidence that I am worse than most people  like in sport when no one picks me to play in their team. And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not. I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias. Most of the people that we see are successful since successful people have more popularity so the sample of people that we are comparing ourselves with is not random.,UgxiQZxHmgRnpVCKp6R4AaABAg,1,1,2020-10-16T18:00:01Z,Uf0dO-pgOrk,user_5840

"I really liked how he talked about learning to like this feeling. I think a physical training metaphor here is really apt. When you work out it hurts and is uncomfortable as you train muscles you may not be using very often. One thing many people who work out regularly talk about is how good they feel afterwards, even though their body is in pain. Similarly whenever you learn something it hurts, almost phyically. You can feel your mind straining to try and understand whatever abstract concept your reading about. For some reason we are surpised by this. ""Shouldn't this be easier?"", ""How does anyone understand this"", or ""The guy in the video I watch made it seem like this was easy to understand"". of course we do not see how long they had to sturggle to actually understand the concept. If we go in with the expectiation, this going to hurt but I love that feeling of brain ache after a good reading I think it can help with those feelings a lot. The other issue is time, the feeling that you need to become competent in a short ammount of time sucks.

"Hi ken, loved the content you have been putting out regarding DS, I have some doubts regarding my situation since its quite specific and I wanted to get your opinion.

I was going to start my undergrad as an Engineer in Data and Mathematics but I have decided to wait one more year so that I can study in Germany (I live in Mexico so returning here with with a German title will allow me to secure a job with ease). In the mean time I have been considering possibly switching majors to something like Economics, or Physics. I have thought of becoming a DS for two years now, however I am worried that the Job opportunities DS promises might shrink and that my degree might limit me the amount of jobs I can find in comparison to the other degrees I am interested in. I am not the best at coding however I have been told that as long as I know how to properly query with SQL (which I can) and have a good exposition of my data, I should be fine. Although I know I would enjoy my time studying something like Economics I feel like it would be really easy for me and I would only want to get in degree in something I struggle with so that I have a more complete profile when I enter the corporate world.

TLDR: I really enjoy the implications of being a DS and want a challenging major, but I don't know if Im cut out to be one and might consider just doing a Masters after an undegrad in something else.",Ugw12KDJ1My-8T0vPHF4AaABAg,1,2,2020-10-16T02:52:09Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_295

I've worked in the manufacturing industry for over 10 years. I strongly believe that AI and big data analysis will bring our industry to a brighter future. Though I'm still struggling in picking up the data science skills, I hope to bring awareness of AI power to more people from the manufacturing industry.

"Hey Ken! Thanks for another great video.
I have a question about projects on resumes. I am struggling to think of ways to quantify the purpose of projects beyond just the results of different machine learning models. Because the results are not really put to use after finding them, there is no real quantitative impact to put on the resume (such as a 10% increase in sales).  Is it necessary or suggested to have this for your projects? If so, what ways might you go about restructuring/expanding upon data science projects to address their possible ""lack of usability"" ?",UgyderoK41ksMKJQ1954AaABAg,1,2,2020-10-14T06:09:27Z,1Ir1NgCuI0Y,user_5522

I've got a physics work background with no degree. I'm looking to go back to school for a masters in physics in mind, but interested in combined/joint degree options. I'm leaning towards mathematics, but with the priority of CS towards Data Science, I might consider the later. Would a bootcamp be enough as long as I do my own projects and networking to keep DS an option, or would you strongly recommend the Phys/CS joint degree over the combined phys/math -> masters -> bootcamp option.

"Agreed, there is no replacement for real world projects.   When tutorials are designed, they will always come to a successful model with good results and will usually have the data nicely prepared for you.  That's exactly opposite of the real world.  You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form, or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data.  That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis. As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems.  I would say if you have an idea of the domain you will be working in, you should focus your efforts on the models and concepts relevant to that domain.  There isn't a whole lot of similarity between analyzing mass scientific tabular data and computer vision.",Ugx-1m56ldMonejk9Fh4AaABAg,1,1,2020-10-11T14:27:06Z,4OZip0cgOho,user_2559

Great video! You should have mentioned RShiny/Shiny apps in your second (third?) bullet point though! But I'm heavily partial/biased towards R haha. Great vid. I like the idea of doing a project involving web scraping. The one thing that can be frustrating about being in grad school for stats is all of our data sets are already cleaned for us. We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it. Scraping data sounds like a good way to get some nice raw data that would require some cleaning and then running some cool analytics on after some EDA.

"Hey Ken, your down-to-basics and straightforward approach to the explaining data science and learning it are very confidence-inspiring to someone trying to get into the field. I have a background somewhat in statistics in that I graduated with an undergrad in psychology but with a focus on statistics. I did 3 quantitative and 1 qualitative study in undergrad and I think I have some chance of using that to my advantage. I'm working currently to pay the bills and keep needs like health insurance available and I'm currently starting the self-study method. I've binged through a few videos and I'm going to try ""ultralearning"" data science, but I'm really not sure where to go from there. I'm going to try to build a good portfolio but I feel like if I just try to say"" I have a degree in psych buut it's with a focus on psych stats"" and then get just a cert or a bootcamp then it won't be worth it for anybody looking to hire. Getting a masters is always on the table but like you said that's a big time and money commitment for no guarantee of a career out of the gate. In the end I think the connections of a bootcamp are more beneficial for me but I also don't want to shell out cash to find out that method would not make me look as good on a resume compared to a degree program. Do you think a psych degree is a handicap or something I can still leverage?",UgxMS6rTvMnswMDBRPd4AaABAg,1,3,2020-10-09T00:09:03Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_4731

You know what I hate about modern day sports analytics? You got all these terms that never existed like 10 or so years ago in sports with strange names that are hard to figure out what they even mean. Yet people continuously write articles referencing them as if the average sports fan already knows what all these are and they're self explanatory even though they clearly aren't and it's fancy jargon that you have no clue what it could possibly mean. Like I was reading an article talking about Breonna Stewarts win shares in her WNBA career. Nowhere in the article did it explain what win shares mean. Obviously it has to do with wins. But beyond that I have no clue. Then there is this other one that has defense or defensive in the title I can remember the full name of the stat but it's a really strange name. It's mentioned all the time as if it's common sense to what it means and we should already know. Lol. Nobody ever explains these things as if they're normal stats.

"Hey Ken, I am in the process of changing my major from a B.S. in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) to Data Science as the ROI (Return on Investment) is sub par in SLP and I have discovered many interesting facets associated with Data Science. I have to take some prereqs before I can apply to my university's B.S. in Data Science program. However, I became concerned as you mentioned that Data Science COULD become oversaturated even if I have a Master's degree (SLP is too since they'll take anyone ranging from pre-med to Underwater Basket Weaving). Will I keep a high-paying job if I make this transition now and have a few years of experience after earning a grad degree, or should I do the following: 1) B.S. in Data Science with Actuarial Science Minor 2) B.A. or B.S. in Stats with a Minor in Computer Science 3) Pick something in tech, business, econ/finance, or another field. After learning from the recent pandemic and reevaluating my college career, I have surmised that I want to do a tech, math, computer, business, or finance/econ-based job from home.

"Hi Ken, tell me what you think of my idea.
Given my age and current educational background and the fact that we are in a pandemic and many companies are probably mitigating risks in regards to hiring, trying to find myself an entry-level data analyst job will probably be next to impossible. I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall. I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive. With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt, I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field.",UgxGf4S_CP7uGxdpFEd4AaABAg,1,1,2020-10-07T01:06:57Z,UpaEjBOMNqs,user_1243

I do not pay for food when I am at work they cater in meals. Heres some personal advice to prepare yourself. Kick all bullshit people and situations out of your life. This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared. You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION>. My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit.  I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior. 

These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data  to one another. You need to be able to show this understanding. You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system. You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features. This is not for everybody. I'm just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at  work and arent truly focused dont apply. If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply. This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs. They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined. I used number four applied with in the company. Yes they paid for the training after selection. By the way the criteria was stiff 90% weighted grades required or you would be let go. There was 19 people in the class 15 made it.

When I was hired 5 people were hired at the same time 4 of those have been fired. Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay. Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time. One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen. One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks. One got fired for Sexual Harrassment.  These people have good money to pay and they know it. PACK YER POOP TIGHT thats Marine speak for SHIT together.",UgwKf4pfo7Ka4NW52A14AaABAg,2,1,2020-10-03T15:12:31Z,UpaEjBOMNqs,user_4399

"Hi Ken, great content. I am torn between certificates and bootcamp. I have PhD in Materials Science and masters in both Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering (2 masters). I was a very happy Data Analyst when COVID Crisis hit (the industry was aviation so yeah...). I also have some experience with six sigma, lean manufacturing and production as well.

What would you advise a person like me? 

I was thinking about getting a bunch of certificates - those offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera seem to be ok (as opposed to IBM Data Science course - this one sucks), also Coursera has several courses organized by Google, AWS, Mongo DB, etc that seem interesting, as they prove presence of some practical skills in real industry used tools. 

What do you think is the better option - bootcamp or a collection of certificates? I leaning towards collection of certificates - this means I don't have to go through the basics of Python programming again, and in the price of the bootcamp (say 2500 usd) I can get some interesting collection of new skill certificates or deepen those I feel need deepening.",Ugzdpqcg1vLgmFCMQmp4AaABAg,2,1,2020-10-02T18:19:15Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_5252
"How Much Math do I need in Data Science?
Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning
 
I. Introduction

If you are a data science aspirant, you no doubt have the following questions in mind:

Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background?

What essential math skills are important in data science?

There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations. Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include:

    Ggplot2
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Scikit-learn
    Caret
    TensorFlow
    PyTorch
    Keras

Thanks to these packages, anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization. However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing to build a model, it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. It‚Äôs important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools.
II. Case Study: Building A Multiple Regression Model

Let‚Äôs suppose we are going to be building a multi-regression model. Before doing that, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:

How big is my dataset?

What are my feature variables and target variable?

What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable?

What features are important?

Should I scale my features?

How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets?

What is principal component analysis (PCA)?

Should I use PCA for removing redundant features?

How do I evaluate my model? Should I used R2 score, MSE, or MAE?

How can I improve the predictive power of the model?

Should I use regularized regression models?

What are the regression coefficients?

What is the intercept?

Should I use non-parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression?

What are the hyperparameters in my model, and how can they be fine-tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance?

Without a sound math background, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to address the questions raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model, please see this article: Machine Learning Process Tutorial.

Let‚Äôs now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning.
III. Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning
1. Statistics and Probability

Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Baye‚Äôs Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation
2. Multivariable Calculus

Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function
3. Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors
4. Optimization Methods

Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels.

Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm)
IV. Summary and Conclusion

In summary, we‚Äôve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning. As a data science aspirant, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm.",Ugzochg_g7ApIOrmjvF4AaABAg,0,2,2020-10-02T17:54:31Z,UpaEjBOMNqs,user_1784

As a basketball fan and a data science enthusiast I loved this video. I would be very interested to see how something  like that (moving the 3 point line back) would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole. I have also talked to people in the past about the idea of simply removing those corner threes and having the arc be 23.75 feet all the way to the sidelines. I think cutting out that corner 3 would have a huge effect on both offensive and defensive schemes.,Ugzg_cgVwD4vStM4oQ14AaABAg,1,0,2020-09-29T02:33:50Z,3BEtGaz70rQ,user_1260

"Hey Ken, I'm back to pick your brain and get your insight again lol. For deploying machine learning models, what cloud service is most used in the industry? Obviously it depends on the model and the use case but I'm having a hard time figuring out what cloud service to use. 

I was doing a bunch of research on turning one of my models into a productionized web app and I was trying to decide between AWS and Heroku. Heroku is definitely way easier and way more hands off but would it look better from a hiring managers perspective if I took the time to learn some devops and fired up an AWS instance with my model running on it? Or does it not really matter and Heroku is fine to use as it is convenient

"Hi Ken,  Many thanks for your interesting and insightful sharing! I 'm from China, and have been following you on youtube. I worked for 3 Fortune-500 companies (European, American) in different roles (research, application, marketing) in the manufacturing industry in the past ten years. I like learning and  taking challenges.
My current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era. I hope to master the big-data-analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry. I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively 2~3 years ago, and took several on-line courses on Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp. I'm major in material science and engineering, much different from CS , mathematcs or statistics. There's so much to pick up! Everytime I feel like learning more, I soon found out much more to learn. It's quite overwhelming...
Your sharing helped me know better about the world of data science. As you advised, I'm now working on the Kaggle competition. Even though, the course I took before had several projects based on the Kaggle datasets and competition, it's my first time to participate in on my own. Besides, this week, I started uploading my work to github and Kaggle to build up my profile.",UgywzupDeMH_uO4GMfp4AaABAg,2,1,2020-09-26T08:01:00Z,Kq9dkZu0bpg,user_841

However I have a background working in product creation in the apparel industry for 10 years. Based on what you‚Äôve said a few times, it seems my best path is working in data science in apparel before transitioning into sports? If I wanted to start building my portfolio, would it be weird to have projects in both categories? Should I only show apparel projects now and do sports for fun?

I found this https://orysyastus.github.io/ github pages website and I really like the way this person has everything laid out and I was just gonna fork it and put my own information and my own projects on it. 

But does that look bad to a future employer? Like I was too lazy to create my own portfolio from scratch? And the other thing I worry about it is what if like 5,000 other people all had the same idea as me and then my portfolio page looks identical to other people that all forked from this same github page lol.

"I applied in hopes that I could get mentorship when it comes to looking for an entry-level data analyst job. All I got was it said I am a bit too early and should brush up on my fundamentals. My goal is to someday be a data scientist, but I realize that is going to take me several months if not years to obtain such role, and have since been solely focusing on acquiring enough skills to land an entry-level data analyst job. I was unable to get assistance from the VA to pursue a master's in data science degree, so now I am left to my own defenses in learning these skills on my own. I have been using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for nearly a year now.  I have completed a handful of data analyst projects and posted them on GitHub. I have over a year with using SQL. I am now taking a Coursera course on Tableau and working on an Oracle Database Administrator certification course. How much longer will it take for me to land an entry-level data analyst job?

Sorry but SharpestMinds is not operating in India. We have a lot of MOOC's available and it becomes confusing in which one to take. To be practical or theory.

I really am looking for such a thing and would really help not only for me but all of the aspirants in India. Please may it available for enthusiast like us .Please can you make it available in India.

"Hey Ken I've got a question for you related to projects and stuff you look for on a entry level data scientists resume/portfolio. I'm trying to decide what I should do for my next project and I'm unsure what will look better on my resume. 

Project A - Kaggle: 
- finish top 10% in a Kaggle competition and write a blog post outlining each step of the process and explaining my thought process of why I chose certain algorithms and my understanding of certain concepts 

Project B - solve a cool problem or answer a question with data science: 
-Pull data from an API database to get experience with SQL or collect my own data source through scraping 
-Clean the data 
-Do some advanced feature engineering with the data 
-Do some testing on different models to figure out which one performs the best 
-Create a website and put the end model into production 
-write a blog post about the project and its results   

Would love to hear your thoughts on this and if you value placing well on Kaggle more than a personal project that solves an interesting question. Cheers!",UgyKyJKfW68Ro_7_zXB4AaABAg,2,2,2020-09-22T21:17:34Z,8Vxjp2KVHqs,user_1357

I‚Äôm currently working in a fairly big bank as a data analyst, the job doesn‚Äôt require the use of very strong programs, excel and Adobe at best. Before I started this job I wasn‚Äôt 100% on going into DS but now that I am, would you say it‚Äôd be a good move to do a master‚Äôs in DS to try and move into more pure blooded data scientist roles? Or is it realistically possible to do that by self teaching with the help of kaggle etc? for context, I have a solid BSc in Maths/Stats so I‚Äôve had a little exposure to R and Python. Thanks in advance!",UgxETH6nCRpAjm5GwLt4AaABAg,2,1,2020-09-20T23:47:33Z,4OZip0cgOho,user_347

"A question here, Ken:
As a beginner, I'm going through lots of books and tutorials to comprehend the concepts of each algorithm and how to apply them, basically using them in a project.
Many of the suggested projects for newbies have been done and posted by thousands of people, including bootcamp projects. Even if I do everything on my own thoroughly, it's still the same dataset, project, and approach. I'm wondering if it's ok to add them to my portfolio, at least until I do a little more advanced projects.",Ugz-l9Rf2EsdIMfw8tB4AaABAg,1,1,2020-09-19T06:42:51Z,apf6A3Nstm8,user_2860

Hello ken. I am a full stack developer and high school student in 12 grade. I have a sound knowledge in this field. I want to be a data scientist. And in front of me there are two options. One is: Go to college and take computer science then learn data science . 2nd one is : Don't go to college and do self study and projects and take some online certificates as data scientist and machine learning engineer and I am ready to give the efforts .But I am kind of confused . Sometime I think I should do self study and real life projects but It also concern be whether it will be a good decision not to go to college. Can you kindly give a advice which will be better because you have a masters degree in computer science. Thank you :),UgytNm2_GE83pqZZuuZ4AaABAg,2,1,2020-09-14T13:57:31Z,4OZip0cgOho,user_2790

"""Narrowing the scope of things I am trying to learn"" is great advise...another great video !

I learned this the hard way after spending months jumping on to follow every tutorial related to data science I could find on youtube - statistics, data analysis, data visualization, deep learning...etc. It was very overwhelming and didn't do much for my confidence as a beginner.

 I think it was one of Krish Naik's video called ""How To Learn Data Science Smartly?"" that saved me where he explains why we shouldn't try  to learn each aspect of data science separately, but rather find some data science projects and learn different topics with context by reverse engineering.",UgynC9gwrvQbArd9S-Z4AaABAg,1,4,2020-09-11T19:20:11Z,jf3j0lWmFPU,user_3979

"It is awesome and very motivating to see how you evolved so drastically!
Thank you a lot for sharing this;
about three years ago I also was mostly unproductive and did not get a lot of stuff done.
I have been continually trying to make small improvements and I have gotten a long way (but I still have an even longer way to go, of course!)

I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus. I have been guilty in the past of trying to do 20 different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes. I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one (or very few) different things at a time.

When you said, that you don't think you have come far, I wanted to add one detail. I don't remember exactly where I have this ""way of thinking"" from, but it was very inspiring to me.
Even if you (as in ""you"" personally) do not feel that you have achieved ""that"" much, it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general. When someone focuses on their own success, they might see that they have done ""average"" or ""somewhat well"", but maybe their actions have affected someone else. And that person affects someone else (else). So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible, I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people. And maybe you have influenced 1% or 5% or even more of those people to do something. And maybe those 5% have influenced their own 5% and so on. 
I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying 66daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building. So I wanted to say thank you, from me, and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit. You're awesome! :)",UgzE2QT3VZIdeBME-bx4AaABAg,3,1,2020-09-11T18:55:47Z,jf3j0lWmFPU,user_830
one thing i started a few days ago and has helped me a lot is I write down goal for my next day and accomplish atleast one thing early in the morning. this gives me a headstart and once i start the process of completing my goals it becomes significantly easier to fulfill them.,UgzwZ9yhMBi3x4k-cwV4AaABAg,1,1,2020-09-11T18:41:51Z,jf3j0lWmFPU,user_4553

"I swear some of the things you said reminded of some of the books you mention:

1. the importance of habits and 2. identity -> Those two go hand in hand together and, one best way to describe oneself is by what we do on a consistant basis. Hence if you can chance your habits, you can chance your identity. 
The growth mindset has been cited in many different book tough I have ""7 habits of highly successful people"". 

Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy, since it's volatile. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have sometimes, but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends, always willing to help, giving a lot of it when it can ... but who can't really always be there on account of having so many people to help .... Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning ;)

Another thing about identity and accounting, and something I've talked about before, is to give yourself proof of what you've accomplished so far and what you are doing right now ... and a bullet journal, for this and feedback (since ppl won't always be there to give it to you) ... this is perfect for this. Make sure to add the proper tracker to it.

And when you feel one of those tracker, that's what Ken Jee here said about about fist pumping and being proud of yourself ... yep, it's very to do that with a tracker and a bullet journal. I can't tell you how many ""YES!!"" I've shouted when marking one ;)

PS:
#66daysofdata
If you watch that video with the intent of applying the advice here to your #66daysofdata ... you might be doing more than 66 of them, and good days they might be just saying ;) (I assume this should count for your challenge in that case). :)

"Hi Ken. I'm looking to transition into data science over the course of the next year or two if possible. I have around 8 years experience in digital media, so there is somewhat of a narrative of ""data analysis"" that I can build on - though that analysis was limited to digital media analytics platforms. The job has given me an edge in terms of communication, presentation-building, etc., but that's where my advantages end. My undergrad is in a non-quantitative major (sport management). I have zero calculus at this time. I spent the first 3 years of my career in sales. And I cannot afford to take an internship at any point throughout the remainder of my career.

I'm currently taking the Data Analysis nanodegree program with Udacity, and getting a really good handle on the analytics toolkit. The programming is coming easier than I expected. From there I was thinking of self-studying the math, and doing the Udacity Data Science nanodegree to start to get the DS foundation. I think I have a reasonable shot of moving into the analytics department at my current agency within the next year. I can start to build a DS portfolio around that time as well. 

With that context - do you suggest I go masters, boot camp, certificate, or continued self-study after that?",UgxxhooQMt-kUl7iuWF4AaABAg,1,2,2020-09-06T16:56:55Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_4333

I have found some frustration from ""not understanding a topic"" but not looking for a different explanation. For example, I struggled to understand what a p-value is and how it is useful; to understand what the p-value was, I found a statistics textbook and read about it. I still didn't understand and felt doomed to never understand p-values. Using your approach of looking for more resources, I was able to get a better understanding of it! It is a great idea to see a topic explained in different ways and by different sources. Thank you for bringing this technique up!

Hope you are doing well. Thanks for an awesome video. I recently started following your videos and the content is too good.

"I am just a beginner and not an expert, but I think beginners should take the first notebook(by Pedro Marcelino) with a pinch of salt. There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook:

1. You don't always need to drop multicollinear variables. 1 most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity. I think, so are other random forest like models.
2. Dropping a variable because it has more than 15% missing data is a bad idea. This threshold is too much in my humble opinion.

There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section.

I am not saying it's entirely useless but it is not great to follow it 100%. It has maximum votes but maybe it's just an outliar in Kaggle's dataset of Notebooks.",UgxSzKYopfgTtKbIh9B4AaABAg,1,2,2020-09-04T17:39:45Z,-pdXWmj9xxU,user_3794

"Great video Ken! Learning from other people's code is a great way to learn. Another great way to learn for me is code reviewing where for example some of my colleague or students would send over their code as a Jupyter notebook where I would go over the code, figure out how the ML model workflow could be improved, could be faster, could add some areas of novelty, etc. such that the resulting research paper would have a chance for publication in a scientific journal. Afterwards, I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance, new areas of novelty, etc. 
On another note, Amazing video editing (pattern interrupts üòÉ), also noticed that you're using Notion as placeholders for the code, great tips! (Wow, I've just noticed how long this comment has become)",Ugxs_B-ZxP-uXzW8Ly94AaABAg,1,6,2020-09-04T16:09:29Z,-pdXWmj9xxU,user_1178

"Hi! I am new to Data Science. I have a Civil Engineering Degree and a MBA. I also understand how to develop algorithms with my knowledge in C and C++ (unfortunately this was over 10 yrs ago), I have maintained the knowledge to develop algorithms, not so much the language. I was taught to visual the problem and find what are constants and what will be the variables. I had also used Matlab in college to write a code to solve triple integrals...which was far easier to do than solving it by hand. I also understand statistics and have  13 years of engineering experience. I have decided to start with learning Python. I am going the self taught method.

Thank you for this video. I am new to your channel. For past month or so, I have been going through your videos to learn more about data science and how to break in to this field.

I have been taking some free courses that you have suggested over the past month (brushed up on my stats, finished two of the Kaggle courses (more in progress),  etc.).

"Wow, I actually haven't seen this one repo - multiple projects folders approach so far; that's a pretty neat idea!
Also it would be great if you answer comments at the end of the video, given that there are relevant questions of course. I think that would put even more information into your already very informative videos!
Speaking of questions: Here's one:
So I watched your Udemy course and how you talked about reaching out to recruiters or just in general experienced people and how you should try to schedule a call within a specific timeframe. You also said it's always a good idea to try and give ""something back"", so to offer to the other person some sort of help. My question would be, what type of help can someone offer, when they are a student or just in general less experienced?

I saw a video of yours where you suggested that for landing a job in the field it's good to have like 4 projects: using regression, classification, clustering, and DL or NLP. My question is after I saw the great work Darwin did, is it enough to just focus on like 2 projects or 1 that are/is in our field of interest is? That maybe the number of projects doesn't matter but the quality and the way you present them do?

"After watching this conversation and doing some careful consideration (including trying Datacamp vs. Dataquest) I ended up subscribing to a month of Dataquest and am really happy a  week in.  The context was that even though I had done a self-instruction path of working on projects, including for my current clients, I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R.  So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas, R, and SQL, working in combination for real-world results, I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky.  Based on this interview in your video, and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs. paying to have it all in one place, organized well, and with a good teaching tool, I opted to try this for a month.  I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge.  I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways 1:1 with current standard practices and knowledge.  Given your 66 days of data science challenge coming up, I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise, online programmatic ad ops.  Interviews like this really do provide a lot of value for those of us looking for answers and realistic, and honest, appraisals of solutions.

"Hi Ken
I actually worked on building a simple Youtube Video categorization model using just the title and description. When I plotted those text metadata using a T-SNE plot I could see that videos from the same category where not compressed together rather they were scattered around forming occasional blobs of different category videos clustered together.

So, I wanted to know that how does Youtube actually categorize its videos because 'title+description' doesnt seem to be very specific.

How about meeting on a regular basis on Kaggle and talking about our progresses? And, of course, help each other out, share notes and, even better, work together on a project once we're good enough one of these days? :)

"I am already in the process of taking not just the habits of doing ML every day (that's a requirement I think when you're beginning and new in the field) but als, recently, I started using my Bullet Journal to record my investment and progress into the field. 
And since I am still trying to sort out a few things both in tracking my progress and trying to establish a clearer road map, seeing this on my computer this morning came as an incredibly great blessing, thank you !!  :)
Now question: Could you and us the rest of your community also have some discussion on, say, Kaggle on regular basis? I feel like that, for newcomers like me, it would help navigate the kaggle ""maelstrom"" and be less intimidated, as well as having a clearer road map.
As for you, it would help you both reexamine your fundemantals through teaching as well as helping you establish yourself as a good, proficient teacher that has both passion for the field and is teaching it with the best of intentions. :)

"Hello Ken! I am in a very fortunate spot where I have the option to attain an accelerated masters degree completely free! It is a 5 year program  Co-Terminal. With that being said I am going to be attending Illinois  ITech and would love to know your thoughts on attaining an accelerated masters in Computer science or Data Science. The pros and cons between the two. I am acquiring a bachelors in Computer science and am wondering if it would be more beneficial to acquire the data science degree with the Internship opportunities down town Chicago or master in CS. I am intrigued in both computer science and data science but I lean towards mastering in data because I feel like a bachelors in CS is already enough. But some people have said that a masters in CS is viewed as more valuable, respectable and versatile. Anyways your expert opinion would be great !please",UgwH4wpHkCrt18mnF_Z4AaABAg,1,1,2020-08-26T22:01:52Z,RRSRKf9eQxc,user_816

"Hey Ken, I was not sure if you saw the response I made on your scraping glassdoor video. But here is the code that scrapes the titles of glass door. 

The main advantages are that it is more efficient(code wise) and it is much faster then selenium. I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again. Anyways, here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor. 

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen,Request
import pandas as pd 
import random
import pickle



headers = {""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.3""}



website = ""https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm""

for i in range(1):
    req = Request(website, headers=headers)
    page = urlopen(req)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')
    for item in soup.select("".jobLink span""):
        print(item.get_text())


Lastly, you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website. Well to answer the former, you would implement a technique called pagination (I will link an article for this) and for the latter, you would scrape each link on the website and iterate through each page collecting all the elements contained on each page.",UgwV_tGfEw_olXI9XYh4AaABAg,2,1,2020-08-26T05:47:53Z,q6Lf2yhvluw,user_1565

I ask because I believe finding some form of mentor-ship from experienced people is one of biggest key or advantages you can get in learning any field, but ML in particular ( your youtube videos and frank kane courses from sundog are good example). 
Of course, gaining some kind of a more direct mentor-ship goes hand in hand with yourself being able to help and make contributions in return (which seems the whole philosophy being kaggle) so I was wondering if you would be willing to share a few secrets there. ( I fully admit that it looks a bit intimidating at first sight :) ).

In any case, thanks for your youtubes videos :)",Ugzgj4kbIK-hpGO7sUJ4AaABAg,1,0,2020-08-24T14:21:59Z,iGUiLWFDWfk,user_1105
"Hi Ken, you recommended having some sort of data collection element involved in our projects but how would you show that? Other than including the datasets in your project files & explaining in a writeup, is there any way to show people what your data collection process is?

"Hey Ken,
to be honest, I (sort of) knew that you were working with 365,
but I didn't know that you created an entire course for this.
It is very good to see that you really try to create as much value as possible!
I think this course will really benefit a lot of people.


Btw: If a hypothetical person would be in the hypothetical position that they already have their portfolio set up and
basically only want to lern about how to network in this field and get their foot into the door,
especially for more of a machine learning engineering, rather than DS role, do you think this course would be a good fit?

"What he said about ""not understanding Kaggle notebook"" is very relatable! I'm a software developer and I started taking interest in data science.
When I read other people's work on Kaggle the first time, I got discouraged because I didn't understand their thought process. As I started doing more courses online through Kaggle, taking other courses, and just playing around with some dataset, I slowly began to understand other people's work.

"Hello there :)

I haven't watched the full video yet, but there's a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I'd like to propose to you for similar videos in the future:

Despite being very VERY green in this, I decided to have a first go at this all by myself ... and boy was and is it still frustrating :P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand. Once I finished my first model, I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob ... which is actually totally fine :) And despite the frustration of the experience, it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this.

And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video .. but only bit by bit, as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible (mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won't hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience).

SO my suggestion is this:
Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts? Or, at the very least, to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem? I feel like it could be very valuable, especially for very recent newcomers like me. 

Anyways, thanks a ton for your videos, very much appreciated ! (especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations, this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future! :)

Plagiarism can't exist in the IT world. If you have a dataset and you need get some data out of it.. there are maybe 25 solutions. Even if people don't know each other they can have the same solution and or have the same way of writing code. In the past i had idea. Didn't talk about it or publish it. I was working on it and about 2 years later(was not done yet) a big company came with the same thing.. I have tried to prove that i came with the idea first.

"Dear Ken, am sorry to hear about this.

The saddest thing is that those who indulge to plagiarism do not understand that this practice tends to damage themselves, and you rightly highlight this aspect.

If we want to strive for excellence, then we must unveil the logic and try hard on our own. Plagiarism does give one the opportunity to feel knowledgeable for one day, but in the long term it will likely show how miserable one is.

The question is, how might we seek out whether we have been plagiarized? 

The topic of plagiarism concerns youtube too. Do you want evidence?
Just look around and see how many times people post videos using copyrighted material. Soccer is one of the many examples. Or TV/radio programs. People merely do NOTHING and try to get visibility - and even money - using other's effort.

"Hello all and Mr. Ken Jee,

It is very humble of Mr. Ken to just have a light eye the  person who copied his work. I am a learning individual myself. I do visit kaggle and github but to just get an idea of how the person has solved the problem and then i take almost one to two weeks to come up with my own unique solution. Solving takes time. Learn from elders and create something on your own. Again Mr. Ken is being very much liberal here. But you will face a big issue when you go for Masters or research jobs. You will get caught and it won't look good. One other thing that Mr. Ken did not address of course he doesn't want to scare the young ones is that a company hold power to blacklist you after being caught of fraud. This means that you won't be able to apply for that company for upto 3 years or forever depending on the policy and also the company can suggest your blacklisted profiles to partner organizations and you will be totally **screwed**. 

Shadow learning is something very important to learn. Shadows learning suggests learning the first principles from others works . This means learning the thought process and not copying the core work. Most of the researchers have 2 ways of reaching a new success. One is making something better or creating something new. Shadow learning is something Einstein has done it himself. He worked as a clerk in a patent office for years going through the research papers or maxwell's , newtons , etc. Did he copy ? Absoluetly not. When he found out that he was a bit lagging in the math section of E=MC^2 he contacted maxwell for his expertise on the derivations. That's how we have Einsein-Maxwells Equation. See. Einstein himself wasn't shy of giving credit to the fellow scientists. Why should kids like us be shy of mentioning a partner or co worker or the sources name or the persons name ? 

Have an open mind like newton. Let the apple fall and create something new. 

Cheers and All the best .

"Great topic and good video. I think you set the appropriate tone overall.
I believe most people learn by copying/following along/mimicry (whatever it is called) at first. I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning. Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top. This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be. 
My personal thinking is that many, many, many (did I say 'many' enough) people forget the internet is open, to a fault.",UgwA0pUvVqrww3AFN2d4AaABAg,1,2,2020-08-07T17:06:44Z,vQGJvmhpq_s,user_2674
"This is a very important topic, I agree!
As you have said, using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general,
however it is important to credit the people correctly.
Some people may think ""I could have written that code myself"", which can of course be true in some situations,
but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature.
If you use a normal sentence such as ""the weather was nice"" obviously you don't need to quote anyone.
But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text (or code, in that matter) it is very important to show the source.
Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code
stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer, even though it is not less important to credit people in
tech than it is in literature.
Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic, I think this is something which should be made very clear!

Edit: When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well. As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well. So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good, because you did the right thing, but also the creator, because their work was used and they got credit. On the other hand, if you don't credit, you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it. So giving proper credit is basically a win-win!",UgzdoraYnEIrmKc53jZ4AaABAg,1,1,2020-08-07T16:41:34Z,vQGJvmhpq_s,user_830
"Thanks for watching everyone! To clear things up, the work of mine was copied in an article that was published on a blogging website that you can make money off of.

"Thank you for this informative video Sir, this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself. As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question. I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche, common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists. In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data, in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis? 
Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level (class 11th and 12th, high school) coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds. The first one being questions related to coding and java, python and c++ and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour. The second round is purely python coding based. I only know vanilla python well (most of the general functions and methods) and have no experience with either java or c++. I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy, math, csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter. Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition? Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit. Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful.
Finally I have one last question, I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question. What's it like to be a Data Scientist, I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he/she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS. I want to know what is a data science life in general, what do you do on off days, how much ""me"" time do you get, what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work. I'm eager to know the ""life"" side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist.
Sorry if the comment is a bit too long, its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions. I'll be really glad if you respond. And again, thank you for making these videos, they are a huge help.",UgyXRA0TIvEDPPPQazZ4AaABAg,3,1,2020-08-07T15:39:29Z,vQGJvmhpq_s,user_2001

I am familiar with Excel, R, and statistical packages like EViews & SPSS, but I was rejected from many Data Analyst internships in the US. So for now I started an internship in Morocco, where I basically make a questionnaire for a certain sampe, collect data, and analyse results. I have been also learning Python and Tableau because they were mentioned in the requirements of most Data analyst internships.

"Thank you for making this informative video Sir! You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume, however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college, how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline. If I restrict my argument to myself, I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree, how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline. 
Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub or Stack Overflow (And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters' eyes), as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I'm also unaware of the do's and dont's. Videos such as these project reviews are extremely useful for more experienced watchers but a video targeted towards the newcomers would be a boon.

"Youtube suggested your channel and I had to watch. It was last week. Then I returned in order to find a video on ""Where"" to start learning. But, what you talked about was ""How to learn"". I mean, the advices were ""No matter what courses you watch, just make sure to do in a way that you feel that works for you. Look into Kaggle and learn from built projects"" and such. However what I couldn't find is exactly where to start on languages. 

Please, please, don't get me wrong I'm just trying to understand where to focus the inicial focus to learn this science.


What I was looking for was something more fundamental, like ""Start learning Progamming Logics, then you should tackle the basics of a programming language like R or Python, then you should learn about DB with...""
I don't even know if it is necessary to learn about database to be on Data Science lol.

Again, don't get me wrong. In reality I'm asking you: What are the fundamentals to start to learn this awesome job?
I see the enthusiasm about this topic on your videos and for a long time I had this will to learn, however I'm not a programmer myself, in any language at all. Could you please, help me to find the initial step?

"You don't know how happy this video made me. I currently have impostor syndrome and I plan on applying to an internship next week. I was worried I wouldn't know enough and that I won't be able to perform to their expectations. Knowing that it's common for DS to reference their old works or constantly use outside resources is such a big relief.  If I end up getting a job, its because of you! You've contributed so much to my growth.

"Hello Ken, really cool video. I have a question for you. You gave us all the important variables that contributed to the model at around 32:30. I was wondering, with those variables in mind, are we able to dig a little deeper and see what the actual values were that contributed most to the model? 
If that sounds confusing, here is an example. Age is the second most significant variable in the model. If we can program what I just asked you, the model would ""spit"" out ages 15-18 years, I do not know if that's true, old were the most significant and contributed most to the model. 
This is my first data science project, so I want to apologize in advance if my words do not sound ""data sciency"" enough.",UgzRBsDUkmKAME2WCcl4AaABAg,3,1,2020-07-29T18:08:19Z,I3FBJdiExcg,user_3132

"Hi, Ken, when tuning the model for random forest, you use RandomizedSearchCV and then GridSearchCV. Your comment is 
""Because the total feature space is so large, I used a randomized search to narrow down the paramters for the model. I took the best model from this and did a more granular search ""
Do your mean the GridSearchCV' parameters are based on the its above RandomizedSearchCV' results?",UgxbM0ptt3bkAgXoN614AaABAg,2,3,2020-07-29T13:03:26Z,I3FBJdiExcg,user_3802

But the masters program, I feel a bit insecure having no background in data science but plan on remedying that by going thru your advice on how to start data science from scratch! , plan to use my first year in personal study while learning the language to learn and gain mastery in data science so by the second year while am going into the core of the program,am caught up,what do u think, too much or just ambitious enough!

"Hello Sir! I'm a student whose currently studying in class 12th and I've chosen the career path of a Data Scientist. Your channel is actually the first channel I've ever subscribed to, because from the first video that I saw on your channel about whether one should choose a bootcamp, a certificate or a masters' degree, I've been hooked to your channel and have seen most of your videos. First of all thank you for making them, its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides, it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot! Secondly I'd like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one, I've seen a plethora of videos and then I've realized that at present the CS is the go to degree, however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I'm trying to think ahead that when I graduate, would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS. I'd be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this.
As for the name of your new beast of a machine, I'd suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology, the Titan of Time (I'm a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan). Kronos would probably be the perfect name because -
1. You said at the start your build was made around your gpu, the rtx TITAN, so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool
2. Seeing the specs I'm sure this machine will be crazy fast and that'll result in much faster response times and code compilation times, seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time
3. The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology, seeing that your graphics card is also golden, i think it makes perfect sense

Once again thank you making these videos, they really are a huge help!
PS: I hope you like my name and the reasoning I gave",UgzfdHhftPe-VK5COmZ4AaABAg,2,2,2020-07-24T15:53:18Z,_rbrdNTpZGo,user_2001

"I recently read something about digital footprints (don't remember where but there's a brazilian video that talks about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb8yXWFRROg&t=479s). It talked about how anything you do or post online, maybe a github account, or a comment on stackoverflow, anything that can help the world see you, is efficient, the important thing is to do somehting.  Sooner or later, opportunities will come.

Great video Ken. A suggestion: I think it would be nice to talk about foreigners  trying to enter the data science market (in your case in the U.S.).

Especially when Eric said that everyone has a personal brand,

but if you want to actively take part in shaping your brand or not,
this really made me reconsider the way I think about showing my work.

"Learning how to learn and breakdown information was one of the best skills I obtained from my academic experience. Oddly, learning data science has been more rewarding thus far, mostly because of being self-reliant on myself and becoming independent. Not having a syllabus and everything planned/laid out in front of you is a skill in itself. It is great to be able to obtain the skills regardless of background as long as you put the work in. This means a lot to me as someone who was a first-gen student, and college isn't always attainable or even the right path. Now to advocate for internet accessibility across the U.S. and also the globe. Thank you both for the informative interview. I will be journaling my progress at the end of the day... we all could use some confidence and motivation.",UgzTrIoK-oKRX_bDpqN4AaABAg,2,3,2020-07-17T13:35:10Z,hO_YKK_0Qck,user_2107

I am currently working on a data science project and was thinking of wrapping it up in a simple Django site.

"Ken Jee,
I‚Äôm about to start my senior year of college and I‚Äôm majoring in physics and math, and I‚Äôm starting to get really interested in data science. I‚Äôm currently working a research internship in medical physics, and I‚Äôm using python with numpy, pandas, etc. to analyze how the accuracy of CT scanners changes from week to week. Even though this internship hasn‚Äôt had me use any physics so far, I‚Äôve found the analysis very interesting. I would really like to get a job in data science without going to graduate school. What would you recommend that I do in the next year while I finish up college to best prepare me to land a job? I go to Texas A&M, so we have a huge network, but I don‚Äôt know where to start (other than using the kaggle courses). I‚Äôve tried looking at job postings and it seems like all the jobs require a masters degree and/or 4+ years of experience.

"Hey Ken, just wanted to say you make some amazing content.  I was also wandering whether you think I should rather complete another Bachelors degree or  straight onto a Master in Data Science? I've ended up completing my Bachelors in Sport and Exercise Science and am currently the middle of my research project in Biomechanics.  Although I enjoy the field I feel like my contributions if I stick with it will be limited to academia and find the idea that my articles may rarely ever be looked at quite disheartening. If I return to university I was considering completing a bachelor of actuarial studies not quite the same as data science but quite closely related.",UgzSaxAa3FWbDvkxoS94AaABAg,1,2,2020-07-14T09:31:07Z,RRSRKf9eQxc,user_199

"Hi Ken Jee, thanks for the great content!  I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought.   Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past 8 years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be.  Anyways,  after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience.  
My question for you is, do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it?  Also, do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience?   
I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python, still need to work more on that.

"Considering that I am now 45 and looking to begin a masters in data science program this fall since my current masters in exercise science has not yielded any sort of suitable or gainful employment, I'd be more than content to find an entry level data analyst role upon graduation from a data science program. Although I have done a handful of projects and have started building a portfolio, I'm hopeful that my chances of getting an internship, landing an entry level data analyst role, or associate data analyst role while going through this master's will be increased.  It's as if I feel starting this masters program will help give me that extra edge to at least obtain the most entry  level position in data analysis versus just my current degree and portfolio. I say this because it seems most job listings require or prefer some kind of quantitative degree, and exercise science does not seem to make the cut. There seems to be too much of a question as to landing an entry level data analyst job even with a much more robust portfolio which I'm sure I could have by year's end.",UgwHzgN-lRqsV5001394AaABAg,1,1,2020-07-10T20:40:04Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_1243
"I found this video to be extremely basic and vague (and the video doesn't quite match the contents: you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners). The general recommendations are fine, but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5.

What tasks are particularly CPU focused, and will benefit noticeably from e.g. Ryzen 9 processor? If it can save you several hours of computing a day, it can be a big deal, but if it says less than a hour, it's mostly pointless.

The same goes for graphic card. Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does. From what I can tell, it's only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti, and cots twice as much. Is there even any reason to get it? Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks? So far it looks extremely cost ineffective, even for highest end PC. Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches.

Again, unless it can save several hours of computing every day, I don't see how it makes any sense at all.

Additionally, I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks. Does it make sense to overclock your RAM, or is it just a waste of time and effort?

Finally, I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU (You listed a 500$ PC, and then you mentioned 200$ for motherboard and other components, which practically increases the price by 50%). Again, depending on how important storage speed is, it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard, such as B550 or X570. However, if it's not as important, and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough, then good B450 board is plenty powerful. As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend one personally. Good ADATA NVME costs just 70-75$ for 500 GB, and is only marginally slower.

My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country, but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations.

For processor I'd get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it's available for under 110$, otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice.

For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz. Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities. Wouldn't get anything below 16 GB, as Chrome is a memory hog, and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects.

For motherboard I'd recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max, as those support upgradability. For cheaper options B450 PRO-VDH Max is also good.

For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500/1000 GB is the best choice (depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC). I wouldn't get anything below 500 GB myself, since this will likely cause major inconveniences.

For PSU anything 550-650W is good enough. I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10+ hours every day. If available at reasonable price, Deepcool DQ-650M is a good choice.

Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science, so anything cheap and sturdy will do.

Graphic card is a tricky one. I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build, but it's hard to find a reliable seller. I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science, as AMD cars get less support. Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend, but if you can afford a more expensive one, 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance. Personally I'd get 1060, and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available.

As for the case, anything above 60$ should be fine. Got myself new MSI MAG case, it's quite, runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre-installed. More premium options are Phantex P400A, and Meshify C.

Secondary components like motherboard, PSU and case may seem unimportant, but they ultimately affect performance, reliability, upgradability and longevity of the system as we.

Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks. 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks.",Ugxn84pxw2qDi-MsktZ4AaABAg,1,0,2020-07-10T19:54:15Z,QQLToUlgN7A,user_439

"Hi Ken,
I was wondering the level of math you need for DS, I‚Äôm getting mixed results in my research. I was a biology major in undergrad and the highest math I ever had to take was calculus I (basically just doing derivatives), and this was a long time ago so I don‚Äôt remember how to do it anymore. I was exploring data science masters back in my school and others, and they‚Äôre open to non STEM majors, and the most math they require was statistics.
  Do you need to know differential equations, linear algebra, and more advanced calculus? Or statistics and the various statistical tests covered in statistics will be fine?",UgyLuvdtd7o8UFw8Uwh4AaABAg,3,9,2020-07-10T16:59:49Z,3Mm1U1CbzNw,user_2687

"i posted this comment below an other video in data science.
i saw that both you and this guy are interested in data science, so i woud like to listen also your tips.
I have a question about data science filed: do you think that a bachelor degree in statistic is more useful than a computer science degree for go into this field? in my country statistic is a sub field of social scinece and there are only few course of computer science,just databases,fundametal programming and statiscal sw. 
A computer scientist has more skills in programming,they study for example more sw exams  (sw enginners,operation system ) but less statistic,probability ecc.
I read that company prefer more computer scientist beacause they dont nedd statistician that are expert in hard modelling,math ecc but they usually ""suck"" in it field,like programming ecc.  but they need only basic knowledge of statistic and a lot of It skills.
So wht do you think, is a good investimetn a bachelor in statisitic or is better a computer science degree? there are a lot of master degree in data science from both accademical course, a lot of people with a bachelour in computer science go in to statistic and viceversa.

"I'm trying to decide if this field is for me. I use Sales Force at work and  occasionally have to pull raw data from it. I use rudimentary search words or phrases to try to isolate cases our front line agents log from their customer contacts.

Often, however, there are limits to the results I get and almost always the data I get is so poorly captured that it inevitably means I have to manually read hundreds of thousands of records individually to see if there are trends. The categorization of the data is a separate challenge of its own.

We have folks who created a system that does this automatically, however, it's still high level information the way the issues get bucketed. It's also about 2-3 days behind so trying to get data real time is another limit.

I'm new to this, so I envision being to run raw data up to hour and be able to paint the picture of what's driving call volume, trends, for example, that we may need to act on immediately and then having technology/automation do the grunt work to classify the data and give me actionable information to present to my team and leadership. But as I see it, there's the obstacle of getting good data from the agents as the major issue in its own.  Is this even possible? Has anyone else run into this?

He does this before he splits his data into the test and train set which causes data leakage (Not as much as a naive upsampling method but since nearest neighbours is being used, some leakage is happening meaning it's generalisability beyond this dataset may be limited) - just thought that would be helpful for anyone using oversampling methods.",UgzP0WeryxV0JNfV-354AaABAg,1,2,2020-07-08T16:26:36Z,B1g_yMKpdwo,user_2228

"Hello Ken, very refreshing videos! üôÇ
I have obtained Master degree in Telecommunications and am working as a network engineer. I have realized that I miss programming so much since I was very good at it and math in high school. I had some programming on college (C, MATLAB, some very basic Python), but since then stopped programming because my job doesn't require it. I like data science, artificial intelligence and Python, so I enrolled in PhD program in IoT where I've got some subjects such are Neural networks and Artificial intelligence in telecommunications.
Please, do you have any advice on how to manage my time since I am doing a job with shifts, have to study and make projects for PhD and need to learn Python, statistics and similar topics in order to make career change and become data scientist?

"Thanks for another great video, Ken! The video editing and transitions are awesome! I certainly agree that one of the misconception of learning data science is limiting one's learning to a particular resource, as you said, nothing is stopping us from learning from another resource. Because the thing is, different resources may bring slightly different angle or coverage of the same topics and thus helps us to gain a more thorough breadth and depth of those topics. Really like the ""rinse and repeat"" part, learning data science is indeed a never-ending iteration loop.",UgymJ5hP7wwkk0Gibmp4AaABAg,2,1,2020-07-03T16:56:39Z,AqPquogHwq0,user_1178

"Hi, I've heard also some negative information about this book ""Why we sleep"". I haven't read it yet by myself (but I want to do it soon), but in the other yt video I've heard that author's research are quite questionable, like lower cancer rate when you sleep less than 8h (something like this). I think this makes sense, because just like diet, everybody's need of sleep is different and it should be more personalized aswell. Nobody should force himself to sleep more if his body doesn't need it.

"Fist of all, thank you for your time making this series. 
It casted a lot of light to me on the big scheme of things in a  project (how you handle it as a whole) Most resources deal just with certain parts so they miss the big picture.

I'm having a hard time...  
I'm trying to get ready a data set (cleaning, inputing, binning, etc)... i wrote individual functions that take the full dataframe as input and outputs it with the respective transformation/inputation/...
Resources mention that is good practice to write functions... So i did... Then i stumble across custom transformers, now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions


What is the difference between using lambda funcitons( like in here) and creating the custom transfomers?

Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps (cleaning, custom value inputing, changing types of values, discretizing, aggregating categories, etc, etc)  to get my dataset ready?
Or what am i supposed to do?
Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling...

I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this...

Thank so much you and keep the good work!",UgzDA0YtTl1czFLc0M14AaABAg,2,1,2020-06-15T21:22:50Z,fhi4dOhmW-g,user_1131

"Nice video! I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail/its length and clicked through - a few other ideas/resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn:
---------------
1. Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices - this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills, but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road (things like docstrings, virtual environments, project directory structure, etc). (Like everything else) this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow - docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers (+ if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't, not playing with margins)
---------------
2. Listening to podcasts about the subject (IMO) is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go - even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about, hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do. Additionally, a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google/stack, and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing. I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners, Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good/fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape.
2.1 Quick addition to the above point, another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems, particularly on the data processing/cleansing/wrangling front have already been solved for - I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library.
---------------
3. Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted - in addition to paid courses/etc, I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube/similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you. Corey Schafer has a  fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics/best practices to end-to-end application development
---------------
4. Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video, I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun/more personal way - it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol. Amongst many others, Spotify has a super user-friendly API and a well-supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work.

"Hey Ken, I recently graduated from university with a major in psychology and a double minor in computer science and mathematics. I struggled a lot with the learning environment of university, and unfortunately wasn't able to pursue a masters degree. Instead, I've taken a real interest in data science, more specifically machine learning, and have starting taking some courses online! I plan on doing a data science bootcamp later, which looks promising from the research I've done. My plan is extremely raw, but I hope to combine machine learning and psychology for the benefit of therapy and other aspects of the human mind! I just wanted your advice and general thoughts on my situation. Thanks so much!

"This was a really great analogy towards the process of learning data science. This reminds me of my data structures class from freshman year where my professor said that even though that most people will have the same type of code to solve a problem, there are many different ways to approach it. Pretty much just like how there are many different ways to learn something. I'm still on this journey as well and just like the advice given here, I use resources that make the most sense to me when I'm developing projects. I relate to the small wins thing as well whether it would be making tutorials for Data Science concepts for the organization that I'm a part of, the Bit Project, or making projects through the knowledge that I have gained through tutorials. Of course my code wouldn't be as complex as someone else's work, the important thing is that I made something that I'm proud of and that the ability to continuously learn will get you far on this journey.

"I already had a solid Math background when I started learning DS - but my graduation was 25 years ago :) I also had a LOT of programming experience, but not in Python or R. And still, my greatest problem wasn't the Math or the Python, it was *lack of the systematic approach*.
When you go for one of the countless ""become a data scientist in 10 hours"" course, you don't really understand that material. The worst thing is you might THINK you understand it, but that's a false feeling. There is no way to understand it all in 10 hours, be prepared for a long journey or retreat. There are three books that I recommend to everyone:
1). Mathematics for Data Scientists (M.P.Deisenroth and others) - all math you will need in a convenient form.
2). Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis (Johh D. Kelleher and others) - everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks.
3). Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron - a great book about Deep Learning (you may skip the other parts).

All three books have a lot of exercises, and you should do ALL of them. After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid. I've stopped on the exercises for the very first chapter for now, though I've read the books, of course :)",UgzPsR1oPWxAcWJvuEt4AaABAg,4,29,2020-06-12T18:12:58Z,XjC3FPL-S78,user_1903

"Hi Ken, as always it's a pleasure to watch your video that distinguishes you from the many yackers around talking about data science.

When i was listening to you, it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about ""selection"", one of the key steps to learning.
In my idea, to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms.¬†
Once we have this shortlist, we can select key programming languages - i personally opt for Python and R - and try to work out real-world problems with these 2 languages.¬†

How, do we do to know if we are gonna do well? One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed (or even in Kaggle, where i have been starting giving a look), implementing to the real-world problems as said above and double-checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary, high-level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica. 
I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines. 

Just sharing with you this crazy ideas ;-) Ciao!",Ugye42WNoNMM1DmTpoJ4AaABAg,0,0,2020-06-12T16:59:54Z,XjC3FPL-S78,user_4348

I think the advice you give is very useful, because I've been following the same methodology when learning Data Science for the past year.

I've been solving Rubik's cubes as a hobby since 2009, so I think I'm pretty good at not giving up when something gets difficult.

"I think learning by doing is a wonderful, fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills.  HOWEVER, after 40+ years developing for large, medium and small commercial, non-profit, military/defense and other companies across communications, strategic data, media, AI, quantum-AI, full stack and other areas, I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary, let alone singular learning approach.   

People who learn exclusive via doing‚Äî especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach, often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of.  Obviously, this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own, or if you have guide(s), mentor(s) and/or teacher(s) that help point out short-comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches. 

There are multiple factors underlying this problem.  First, it is very hard for most people to deeply self-introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical, theoretical and contextual reference.  This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning-Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self-educated without a broader base of external references as noted above.  

The second factor is the fact that most of the time, most people simply do not know what they don‚Äôt know.  In other words, it takes a broad base of external theoretical, historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base, and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions.  While working on our own is a great way to learn deep, practical skills, we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches.  In other words, you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare, and that you don‚Äôt know how to optimally use even the tools you do have.  For example, we see people who have never heard of Donald E. Knuth, JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing, who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed, resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups‚Äî ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community.  

So, while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education;  even hands-on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach, where you work autonomously, but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself.

The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years.  As such, by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience.  The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity.  For example, the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12-14 months and is still falling.  

This means that on average, AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI.  Increasingly, the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping, as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide.  As such, more people are self-educating, often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training.  

Sadly, many of us who don‚Äôt get the academic knowledge and theory up front, never go back later to address that, since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs.  So, the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier.  Often they become highly proficient programmers and such, in whatever language(s) they happen to need for the tasks at hand, but they often don‚Äôt learn to intuit when, for example they should turn to something like Node.js versus Python, or use Matlab vs Tensorflow, etc,

So, what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands-on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled, and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive, theory and analytical skills development?   The result is that suboptimal approaches, zero hour bugs, and higher rates of failed projects, as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW.   

Further, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD‚Äôs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint, what are the alternatives?  First, online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in. 

Also, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more.  We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhD‚Äôs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people, what are the alternatives.  First, online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn.  Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.  For example, say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift.  You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books‚Äî at the very least in the areas you are focusing on, and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit.  Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas.

Similarly, it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills. While the pay may be minimal or non-existent, EVERYONE (self-taught, university skilled and all other modalities of learning) should intern‚Äî just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine.   And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative.  In medicine it is done on top of 6-9 years of additional post-university graduation education, while in computer programming, a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit‚Äî let alone intern/apprenticeship training.   

Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge?   Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average‚Äî and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills, compensation and job satisfaction.  So, don‚Äôt migrate primarily to hands-on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you, because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency, knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so.",Ugw59or26G9iQZ4Yayl4AaABAg,0,1,2020-06-06T18:28:57Z,4OZip0cgOho,user_434

"Hey you, Ken! Really nice channel you have here. You've got one more subscriber. =)
.
Here in Brazil we have this kind of discussion every day. And for the ones who is not from the field, but really passionate about data and the math behind it - and of course have enough time to do so -, won't you recommend a second bachelor related to the field? For example: Statistics, Computer Science, Mathmatics, and so on? 
.
Briefly, I think for the tools, softwares, programming languages there are no better place to learn them than in online courses. Thus, the bachelor would give us the theory we need and in parallel sharp our skills with online courses. 
.
I'm curious to know your opinion about it. Cheers from Brazil, buddy!",UgzmdRutZoyRnolJAkd4AaABAg,1,2,2020-06-05T11:10:13Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_1863

"Hi guys! 
So, it seems like this has stopped working, I found the fix on Github tho, 
Here's how to go about it: 
This can be fixed by modifying the header dictionary in query.py from
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST)}
to
HEADER = {'User-Agent': random.choice(HEADERS_LIST), 'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'}
that should fix the issue.

"Hi Ken, i need your honest opinion man

I'm confused in choosing between Data Scientist or UX Designer

There are few questions about this topic, but i want to ask from different perspective

I am right now a content creator, was a videographer so i do edit videos and such

Visualization is always a part of me, i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music

But what i asked is much bigger than that

I know lots of people talk about what you're more into, if maths go with data science, if creative go with ux design

However, i want to know how's the life of both careers? Which one offer better work life balance?

Because when i did creative work, i didn't really have work life balance, i did a lot of overwork stuffs, because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours.

When i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project.

Then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable? Because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future, companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet. 

Third, when you become the CEO of the company. Which skill is best to master? Data science or ux design? That will absolute critical as someone in that position. 

Like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you",UgxKGQhrM7h3HfQDrsZ4AaABAg,2,2,2020-06-02T06:22:14Z,mR2NCRgtLPE,user_289
"So on 31st May I searched youtube for ""Data science portfolio website"" and found this awesome video posted just 2 days before! I have made my first portfolio website thanks to you guys!! Thank you!!
One heads up for anyone making their own site in this way:
After uploading files some of the images might not load on the page (when run using Github pages)
This happens because some images that were uploaded have the src = ""/images/.."" 
To get the photos simply edit the index.html file for the pages where the images are missing. 
Change the ""/images/.."" to  ""https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfolio/images/.."" and the images will show
This was something I faced and that's how I fixed it. Hope this helps and hope you all make the website you want!",UgwrhhjfbyId46xShNp4AaABAg,2,1,2020-06-02T05:05:26Z,mEZ1Hj5yQ-8,user_2348

Ken¬¥s project series from scratch inspired me to start my own project. The result you can see in this video. But it was a lot of time and effort to get to this point. So, it¬¥s a nice compliment, when someone thinks, that my project can¬¥t be from a beginner.

Hi Ken. I'm an experienced financial controller with a MSc in business administration and I took a leave of 6 months. I am looking for a career change to data science and already did udacity Programming for data science in Python. I only have until october to focus on this career change  and was thinking taking the ironhack bootcamp for data analytics (https://www.ironhack.com/en/data-analytics). After october with my demanding job and kids will be impossible for me to study.  I'm looking to be ready for a data analytics role as an entrance in data science market.

simple answer: Bootcamp. I speak from experience. I have only  6 credits left to finish my MS Computer Science degree and I can tell you right from the bat.......I learn more about tools that I will actually use on the job market from youtube not from my masters classes.

I am not a data scientist or interested in it but i do a bit of data analysis in my field of learning and development. I primarily use R and I would encourage people not to shy away from R. It's different from pythion because it is a domain specific language while python is a general purpose language. R has some great packages such as the Tidyverse which allows very easy exploration of data. Also you can use R and Python together.,UgxTBqc15jP5Z-yX3LR4AaABAg,2,4,2020-05-26T11:13:43Z,VN12ZPFsApM,user_2957

"Liking this Review series!  Absolutely agree with you at 14:38 that tree-based methods may be useful for giving feature importance but the lack of direction in which the features influences the model render it less useful than that of linear model's regression coefficients. Recently, I have been experimenting with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and it is filling this need by also giving the direction at which the feature influences the base values along with the magnitude as in linear models, and the great thing is that it works on nearly all ML algorithms too (tree-based included).",Ugzy0NIB0mdhFmKaX-d4AaABAg,1,3,2020-05-25T15:03:36Z,HJH0gfY6EUg,user_1178

"Hello!

Just wanted to throw this out there. I am 27 with a degree in Finance and a real passion for technology/programming. I was a comp sci major in community college, but didn't give it the time it needed and eventually switched to finance. I quickly realized that I wanted to do something that I was passionate about which is numbers and programming. I found data science. So far on my journey, I have acquired a Certificate in Data Science from UCI (very high-level stuff, didn't really go into great depths, mostly theory), but I always have these doubts that I am too old to get into tech or that I don't have enough real world experience to get into tech. I work hard everyday after work to learn more and more about  data science.

I think your advice really is valuable even to people outside the US, even though of course the formalities may differ, f.e. in Europe it is much more common (or even expected) to include a personal photo on the resume, but I think that the essence of interviews and what recruiters look for is generally the same across the countries, especially for larger companies like FANG etc. I think the interview process does not differ much.

"Hi,

I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I've been out of college for about 2.5 years now and have recently made the decision to switch to Data Science. I have a decent level of programming experience from my time in college/work with Matlab and C++.

And I'm trying to figure out what the best path to this would be for me? I'm not really in a position to stop working, but my company will pay for me to go back to school up to 10k per year for graduate programs or 5k per year for certifications.

Just I have a question that terrifies me. Do I need to be a math wizard? Just the word algorithm terrifies me.
I always struggle with numbers, even now I miss the most common and simple operations.

"I have become very confused with the different advice various people give regarding data science. The coding languages like R and python seem to give the user a more technical and intricate level of work but these don't seem inviting to me when there are options like Matlab available which is significantly more user friendly especially for beginners. I graduated with an engineering degree last year, I have since tried to study machine learning with python after having no background in the language and it seemed more difficult to study and memorize all the different algorithms one has to go and create or the the different uses of packages like numpy. On the other hand I started a course on data science with MATLAB and the ease of graphing and using visual aids seemed to make Matlab a more desirable choice for me. That being said, I don't really hear of Matlab being a buzz-word in the data science community, why is this? Where would Matlab be more applicable than software languages like python or R?",Ugzz7GhZ0uOn2gd8vVh4AaABAg,1,0,2020-05-18T20:58:39Z,4OZip0cgOho,user_4620

"Hello, Ken. Regarding the applicability of your advices outside the US, I can speak about Brazil (my home country) and France (the country I currently live). Basically, everything you said so far applies equally to both places, specially regarding the number of pages in the CV. I've been working with engineering for some time now, and in Brazil I see a certain tendency of giving more importance to soft skills than to technical skills, at least in my area. The idea is that you can teach somebody how to program, for example, but it's really hard to teach someone how to have be a good team player.

Very cool analysis.  I wonder if you could get the data on strikeouts.  I remember seeing some discussion that the Astros' team strikeout % was significantly lower than the MLB average.

"Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. We‚Äôre not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 

2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, ‚Äúalmost no companies know what data science is‚Äù. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: it‚Äôs the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. That‚Äôs it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. I‚Äôm telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 

3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesn‚Äôt say data scientist doesn‚Äôt mean your not going to do data science work. I‚Äôm a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server,  Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDE‚Äôs get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. 

My job title is NOT data scientist. 

My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of ‚Äúmust know Python‚Äù, it‚Äôs a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist don‚Äôt know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldn‚Äôt tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print  ‚Äúhello world‚Äù in Python. Yet they‚Äôre interviewing candidates for Python development. üòÅ

If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills. 

Good luck!",Ugzb1fCulqpJm9blNmV4AaABAg,1,1,2020-05-17T14:05:21Z,4OZip0cgOho,user_2886

A master degree could be a great choice if I want to move to a data scientist type of role. I wonder if you could share your thought a little bit about  a master in DS vs Stats. My concern is DS programs are relatively new, and maybe most hiring managers are suspicious about the program and expectation of candidates are not established yet, so they would rather choose candidates with stats background. And plus, fundamental knowledge of stat could potential help solving hard core tasks in career later. Could you please share your thought on this please?

"Hi Ken,
I have a question for you: I'm studying social sciences at the moment with a specialization in quantitative data analysis. We're not just doing basic stuff, I already did courses on geodata analysis, network analysis (even did an analysis of Twitter communities with data that I scraped with the Twitter rest API), multilevel models, structural equation models and causal analysis. But we have no courses on machine learning (actually there would have been a course this semester, but it got dropped because of corona -.- I guess it's too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning, idk...). And we also didn't do much on efficient coding / speeding up the code. I'm mostly working with R.
What do you say would be a good next step to get deeper into data science with that pretty solid foundation of knowledge on statistics? Can you recommend courses, books or other sources for my situation? All the data science sources that I found were starting from zero which was a bit annoying for me.

Thanks!",UgysVlATmXBG9zydk5Z4AaABAg,2,2,2020-05-13T18:44:19Z,4OZip0cgOho,user_682

"I am a physics phd student and i also work a full time job, i knew programming would be someting i will love and master since we first got introduced to pascal 7 years ago and matlab and fortran later( that's all we learned, but it gave me the basics) , so now i want to learn Data science for my phd work ( i could just use a software that everyone else use at the lab to analyse and visualise my experimental data) and also to have a job as a DS too, it's perfect now with the quarantine i have more then enough time to learn.

So, do you think i can learn DS in 3 months?i learned python the last two weeks it's easy but i didn't build any projects yet.

"Hello ken! New subscriber here.
My current situation is that i've graduated with a Honours in Biochemistry and last year i enrolled into another undergraduate degree in Computer Science because I figured I would switch my career in hopes of finding a job. After completing my 1.5 years, I've decided to take on a Data science course on udemy and has since created 3 personal data science projects. Do you think that's good enough and that I should apply for jobs or should I just finish my Comp sci undergrad.

"I'm in Ireland so the set up is a little different but my original degree was in social science and now I'm doing a higher diploma in Data Science.  This is a post grad qualification that is an add on to your degree but it's not quite a masters either.  Personally I'm coinciding that with different online courses or certificates.  The diploma is  two years part time and it is designed for people with no data science background so there is a lot to cram in. Naturally there will be area's that i'm weaker in or where the diploma does not go into detail as I would like so I use certificates  to fill those gaps.  Mid term term breaks, winter breaks and soon summer breaks are a good time to do these when lectures are no longer running and you've finished up exams.  In saying that university education in Ireland is  a lot cheaper.  My first degree was free and this higher diploma is around 4000 euro in total so I don't mind spending an extra little bit to do some courses in my own time.",UgwrgwCrhQ5cPAk3lih4AaABAg,3,1,2020-05-12T12:55:36Z,Q9FjwzKFPuM,user_4311

Great video, you gained a subscriber here.
I like more books rather than videos but I will definitely try kagel.

Practical Statistics for Data Science; (read)
R for Data Science; (read)
Introduction to Statistical Learning with R; (read)
Elements of Statistical Learning; (on it)
Advanced R; (next)


Any books you recommend to fill some gaps here?

I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree, and I would love to transition to the field of Data Science. I am planning to do that by enrolling into the Masters Program. Another reason why I want to get the Masters is because I am planning to immigrate into another country, so getting a degree there would be one of the best options for me, as I can't get a job in DS right away. During my university years, I've been introduced to most of the basic concepts of Statistics and Calculus. I've completed a few DS courses online together with some CS and Programming Extension courses.

"Hi Ken, thanks for your sql tutorial video, which is very helpful and inspiring!. I have a question in regards to subquery you mentioned in the video.   
select bat.*, pitch.*
from dbo.Batting as bat
inner join (select *
from dbo.Pitching
where W>=10) as pitch
on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID
where AB>=40
instead of using subquery in inner join, I use normal inner join and put W>=10 in where clause, which came out the same result:


select bat.*,pitch
from dbo.Batting as bat
inner join dbo.Pitching as pitch
on bat.playerID=pitch.playerID and bat.yearID=pitch.yearID
where Ab>=40 and W>=10;

I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

Thanks for valuable info.

from consumers perspective:

-Recommendations of alike products
-most vieew products such as you search
-processing text from a written list of products and searching the data base for those prodcuts
-users personalize input to search for best fit ..question for this woudl be; what categoriy of product you would like to buy? (this could be on or varous catergories), Do you  want the lowest to the highest price or you dont care?, do you want the nearest to the fardest location? ansd so on 
from retail perspective:

- profille of users
- goal clint 
- setting of weekly and monthly  goals
- reocomendation of which products to buy from markets feedback
- recommendation of products to buy from two alike products (based on demand, profit/cost, and snetiment of consumers about the product)
- sentiment analysis from consumers to products of the retailer
- sentiment analysis from consumers to overall perfomrance of retailer
-data visualization

I agree to the statement that DS has really changed over the past few years.
Because it is such a young field I think that the landscape will change dramatically even for the next 5-10 years.
My personal goal as a (now) first year university student is to stand out amongst my peers,
more than 50% of every CS student seems to be interested in ML, but only a very small percentage of those really
commit to the entire journey, which I really want to do.

"A lot of the described disadvantages aren't as bad in the UK. Courses are all around ¬£10k (12k dollars) and we're given standardised student loan. Also, once you're accepted into the course, you tend to be allowed to select any module you want, even if there are advertised prerequisites.

Agreed that documentation is a plus for potential employers, a well documented code/notebook goes a long way in reproducibility of data science projects. Speaking of making websites and hosting on GitHub, Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) is a great tool, it is a static site generator that automatically creates a website directly from markdown files and it could be hosted on the github.io.

"Great video!
Generally I think the younger someone is
(or in general the earlier someone stands in their career/education)
the more impressive extraordinary projects become.
If you're a high school student and you create your own DS project whilst 
collecting own data, that is a lot more impressive than if you're in your final graduate year.
Even though it is never too late to start, I really want to try and make cool
projects early on so that I can build momentum as early as possible.
With the DS market becoming more and more competitive, I think these
uncommon achievements are going to be valued more and more,
especially in larger companies (FANG etc.) where already today
they are probably more of a requirement than an add-on.
Nevertheless, great video! I really hope to land an awesome internship myself in the coming year(s).",UgxQOyz2sueMcHdFOBJ4AaABAg,1,2,2020-05-02T06:26:06Z,KHAuuOQui2U,user_830

"Hey Ken,
(warning: longer comment incoming)
I've been following you for a few months now and I've been thinking
""Man, I really need to write a comment stating how much I appreciate this channel"",
but I have been putting it of for long enough, this video finally drove me to the keyboard.
It is really inspiring to see you consistently trying to upload informative videos about Data Science
and really giving back to the community. You are a great motivation for me to keep going
and striving towards a career in Data Science (or even Machine Learning Engineering).
I clicked through your social links and noticed that you have a really well documented system
including your GitHub, personal website. Medium posts and this YouTube-Channel.
With a full time job besides all of that it is really impressive to me how you can manage all of these sources
and be so consistent with it. I'd love to have my project reviewed by you, even though at the moment my GitHub
is my least well documented source (xD). But you definitely inspired me to put more time and effort
into polishing personal projects and really not letting loose on those last 20%.
I am almost certain, that within a year or two your channel will become very impactful in the DS community
and that you will see very positive results. Your content is very informative and helping.
If I tried to point out some minor areas of improval it would actually not be based on the content itself, but rather
on aspects surrounding it (such as presentation, background noise, ... ) but I am sure you are aware of this,
recently I have noticed quite some improvement in those areas as well, so all I can say is chapeau!
I am really excited to see how far you will come in the next months, you definitely won me as a loyal fan of yours :)",UgwyHHBJKHrmTL-lH8t4AaABAg,3,4,2020-04-27T16:39:52Z,DW55gaQ_Egk,user_830

You are doing great job. I just want to suggest you 2 things.
(1) - Zoom on the coding part, bcuz its very hard to read code when you are on mobile.
(2) - Use jupyter notebook instead of this... As the interface is very clear and friendly...",Ugz--7iFNiSAUTx4Tfh4AaABAg,1,7,2020-04-19T12:38:12Z,Z9dGmL2G-4k,user_5233

"Hi Ken, Thank you so much for the series and everything you have done so far in this chanel. In case of the series ""Data Science Project from Scratch"", this is something I was looking for. Practical knowladge, without cutting, with using Google if it's necessary. Definitely, you helped me a lot to sort my knowledge and add some interesting tips. Keep a finger crossed for development of your chanel and if I can say something negative, then... I would rather to have a possibility to give you more thumbs up :D",Ugwf15lxrUm505viafl4AaABAg,1,0,2020-04-11T08:51:12Z,QWgg4w1SpJ8,user_3028
"Hey Ken,
Is it just me that I'm unable to see the salary component on the left-aligned job summary columns. I'm able to see only 1. Company Name, 2. Job Title, 3. Location. Is the Salary estimate not visible on the updated Glassdoor page?
I got '-1' as salary estimate for all jobs.¬†And this is the same URL from Omer Sakariya's code.

"Hey Ken, enjoyed some of your videos. Really enjoy data science have a pretty good background as an IE major. Looking to improve my skills. One concern I have. I got on Kaggle for the first time and I was pretty excited to find these useable data sets to work on some of my data vis skills. Saw they were downloadable zip files and that immediately scared me, but I naively thought everyone else uses it and a quick google search brought up no safety concerns. After downloading about 3 data sets. I am pretty convinced i downloaded some malware. Got multiple warning signs from the browsers I use and then a bunch of random sites jumped up and teamviewer popped open. Immediately shut down and disconnected everything. Is this normal? Do you have any tips for safely downloading data sets etc?? Would really appreciate. Thanks",UgzNeYGTCLhUGkbE2xB4AaABAg,1,1,2020-04-08T06:21:11Z,8igH8qZafpo,user_853

"Hi Ken, 


Thank you for your advice! This has been very helpful as an aspiring data scientist. I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio. To quickly summarize, I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song (For example, tempo, major, acousticness, and valence are a couple examples). I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features. However, there was very little correlation so I said that the model (using multiple linear regression) I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting, and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error (which was very large; although there were some predictions that were close). 


In your opinion, would this suffice as a good project? If not, do you have any insight on how I could improve?

"You spent almost half of your presentation talking about Machine learning(feature engineering, clustering, regression etc). In my humble opinion Data science has a lot to do with other aspects other than Machine learning. I realized many people focus a lot on machine learning which shrinks a lot of the aspects of data science. Kaggle, for example, encourages folks to hone their machine learning skills. Kaggle isn't a good place to learn full fledge data science skills. Data collection,  Data Cleaning, Data manipulation, Exploratory Data analyses where all left out. Kaggle mostly brings ready-made datasets which limits many kagglers the ability to effectively develop their data science skills.

One question regarding Google Colab though. Do you use the TPU setup or the GPU setup? I've been told that TPU performance is a lot better than GPU's and I was curious what you actually use?

"As always, great video!


One idea I haven't heard of before is focusing on one project and learning only the specific skills necessary for that project. Everyone's experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science / ML / DL journey, and we're usually hit with the, ""learn all of statistics, all of programming, and all of math"" mentality that is drilled into our heads. This can be enough to scare people away, and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case.




It's really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects (sports and sports betting). My question is:


Do you stay within that domain at work?


If you do, do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well, and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job?
If you don't, would you agree that it's still valuable to choose a specific domain? Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports / sports betting transfers over to your current job/position?

"What about adding a 2.5-point line a little bit closer to the basket than the current 3-point line (2 feet closer?), that would give a boost to the no-man's land and the now reluctantly taken and often frowned-upon mid-range jumper. And then moving the 3-point line a bit further away. I think this could eventually make the game more interesting. It only takes a bid getting used to 0.5 points; and if you are fouled while attempting a 2.5 point shot, the first time team gets 2 free-throws, next time this happens 3 free throws are rewarded.

Went through your linkedin profile and found that you've done your masters from Depaul University.
I have been working as a Data Analyst for the past two years and was thinking of pursuing a graduate degree in the same university. Some questions..

Can you do a review of DataQuest? 

How much should I study a day? I‚Äôve been studying 6-8 hours a day, after I finish my full time dead end job, just so I can get into a company I want and start being a data scientist. Rn I‚Äôm a beginner, just started in Feb, learned python, OOP, NumPy and Pandas and now I‚Äôm doing data aggregation and cleaning. Anyways, where can I practice?

"Thanks for this video Ken. I have a sports analytics problem for you. When the 3 point shot was first introduced in the NBA, I said start launching them. Traditionalists said, oh no, too risky, too many will ruin the game. 20+ years later 3 point shots are an integral part of any teams' strategy. OK, my question is regarding the 2 point conversion in football. My belief is that the 2 point conversion should be tried every time. Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion. Plus, once fully developed, these plays could be used for any regular down inside the 5 yard line. The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited - 2 QB's on the field, 5 running backs, non-traditional formations, etc. Not to mention how exciting the game would become. Do you have any supporting evidence that, over time, going for the 2 point conversion 100% of the time would pay off? I guess part of your problem is that you cannot measure what hasn't been tried.",UgzbLTvd5RV4dt3l2O94AaABAg,1,1,2020-02-17T15:21:02Z,8igH8qZafpo,user_1646

"Thank you for this video! I have a nice video suggestion.
How to implement Data Science into a working business?
Let's imagine you have a business that produces refrigerators. One single small factory, a sales team, etc.
I know that Data Science can help make any process more efficient, let it be the energy consumption, the production itself, supply chain, sales, marketing, etc.
What could one do to implement data collection and data analysis in a company like this to analyze data and drive insights to make a business more efficient? What are some real-life examples, software names, etc? What is your related real-life experience?
I don't ask for a whole sophisticated tutorial, the basic overview kind of information would be enough, so a person from a non-technical background could learn how to implement Data Science in business.

"Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket.  With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.


The NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix.",Ugxh-tD0aMF2x8ecdn94AaABAg,0,0,2020-02-06T21:01:18Z,3BEtGaz70rQ,user_3552

"Great resolutions! Some of my comments:
1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a ""good code"" by engineers. But obviously if you can't efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren't ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting ""classic"" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both.
2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be ""consumed"" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don't have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it's rather inefficient.
3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it!
4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it's like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don't change as often.
5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.


My resolutions:
1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.  NOT being just a ""cog"" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work.
2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels.
3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren't data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo)
4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML
5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert
6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don't have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what's going on in our field)
7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I've been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I'll be able to make it useful soon!

"Ken, great stuff! Thanks for walking us through your simulation. 

Quick question: the way you calculate the score seems to skew the comparisons if one of the scores is high. 

For example:

If one team score is say 140-139 it averages to approx 140. The other team score is 120-90. It averages 105. So the team that won by 1 gets the win in the sim cause they scored a lot of points. But the other team won by 30 and had a better defense.

Do you see my point?

I'm thinking you ought to subtract and return a margin of victory then compare the margin of victory. Maybe worth running simulations to see how different they are?

Love this video and this kind of content.  I can imagine that if the line was moved back to 25 feet that there would be a massive trickle down effect.  Great shooters would be even more valuable and spacing would be insane in the nba for teams who can convert from that far out.  Corner threes would be a cheat code at that point too since they cant be moved back any further.  I wonder if the court will ever get bigger to address this.

 1. be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into learning (in truth, the learning never stops. üòÅ)
 2. be proactive about finding problems and solving them (plus, keep in mind there's a difference between asking for help because you're truly stuck vs. asking for help because you're too lazy to figure out how to solve a problem.

"Hey Ken,  I have a few data science projects(python/sql) that i'm working on while taking edx classes but also work full-time as mech engineer trying to switch careers. The emphasis on masters seems to be quite apparent among DS jobs especially in Cali. 


If I want to go through masters in cs, i would have to be part-time(financial reasons) but also put all my projects on hold due to time constraint. It would take roughly 1 year for me to get around solid 4-5 projects to complete but 2.5 years for my masters.


What are your thoughts about this? going the personal project route or masters route? I wish I can do both but that is a recipe for a burnout. I enjoy the technicality of DS and want to get into the industry asap.

"Hey PSA (maybe pin this or comment this yourself) but 1.2.0 as of right now doesn't really work. It's query_tweets is broken and you're going to have to specifically install 1.1.0 (pip install twitterscraper==1.1.0) in order to use it. 


Also, for anyone wondering about performance issues and harvesting tons of tweets, make use of the poolsize parameter. Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time. At maximum you can have one scraper per day. So for example, if you are scraping a period of 30 days, you can use poolsize=30 to get 30 parallel scrapers running at a time. If you want to harvest over a big time frame, try to harvest smaller time periods and loop through dates manually (otherwise your CPU, RAM, and internet usage will shoot through the roof). That should give you the best mix of performance and speed.",UgyUymUKeY7nfgJ8eYZ4AaABAg,3,2,2019-07-25T18:46:10Z,zF_Q2v_9zKY,user_758

"One more question, if I would like to write the tweets (from this method, with a track word) to a json file how do I access the tweet info?

For example, when I want to print the tweets:

I get something like this, which I understand but I'm not sure how to retrieve the actual information from it. Looking at API documentation, the tweet object should have attributes like 'text' and 'id' and so on. But when I try tweets['text'] I get an error instead.

"Hello everyone! Dan, one of my followers, pointed out that in this analysis I actually included the dependent variable (minutes played) many of the methods that I tested. Obviously, this is not something that you should do. After re-running the analysis with the correct adjustments made, these were my findings.


Just Previous Game Prediction Score:  7.991422567954051
Previous Three Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.937990350926065
Previous Five Games Rolling Avg. Score:  6.82599267659377

Previous Five Games Rolling Median Score:  7.111145383454696
Previous Ten Games Rolling Median Score:  7.079332689005398


It looks like the past 5 game rolling average is actually the best performing of this group. 


Linear Model Performance: RMSE =  6.3429443807711765
Random Forest Performance: RMSE =  6.284779430662026
Combined Model Performance: RMSE = 6.276509665369035

As expected, the ensemble model performs the best. It appears that adding the linear component does provide a small amount of lift to the results.

"Hi Ken, my name is Peter. I play a bunch of DFS and I do pretty well, but I have a glaring deficiency and it's my lack of programming / statistics skills. I enjoyed the video on NBA minutes. I think I have some ideas that could make your models even better than they already are, and we could both benefit. My email is PeterTaranovich@Gmail.com. Let me know if you have any interest in collaborating. Regardless, it's a great video and I appreciate you posting it.",UgzcouzpDyzGFyGQzwN4AaABAg,0,0,2019-01-18T05:48:37Z,sCOX5yShmFA,user_3344
