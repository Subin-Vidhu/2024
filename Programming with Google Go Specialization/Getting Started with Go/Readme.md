 - Why should you learn Go? 

    -  Advantages of Go:
        
        1. Code runs fast: 
        
            - Go is compiled to machine code, which makes it faster than interpreted languages like Python or Ruby.

        2. Garbage collection: 
        
            - Go has a garbage collector that automatically frees up memory that is no longer needed.
            
        3. Simpler Objects: 
        
            - Go has a simpler object model than languages like Java or C++. This makes it easier to learn and use.

        4. Concurrency is efficient: 
        
            - Go has built-in support for concurrency, which makes it easy to write programs that can do many things at once.

### Software Translation

 - Machine Language: 
 
    - The lowest level of programming language, which is the language that the computer understands. It is made up of 1s and 0s. ie CPU instructions represented in binary. eg. 01010101, 11010101, etc.

- Assembly Language:
        
    - A low-level programming language that is a more human-readable version of machine language. It uses mnemonics to represent CPU instructions. eg. ADD, SUB, MOV, etc.

- High-Level Language:
            
    - A programming language that is easier for humans to read and write than machine language or assembly language. eg. Python, Java, C++, etc.

- Compiler: 
            
    - A program that translates high-level code into machine code. It reads the entire program and translates it all at once.

- Interpreter:

    - A program that reads high-level code and executes it line by line. It translates the code into machine code as it goes.

- Source Code:
    
    - The code that you write in a high-level language.

- Object Code:
    
    - The code that is output by the compiler or interpreter. It is in machine code.

- Executable:
        
    - A file that contains machine code that can be run by the computer.

- Bytecode:
        
    - An intermediate representation of the code that is used by some languages. It is not machine code, but it is not source code either. It is often used in interpreted languages like Java.

- Virtual Machine:

    - A program that runs bytecode. It simulates a computer so that the bytecode can be executed.

- Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT):

    - A technique used by some languages to improve performance. The bytecode is compiled into machine code at runtime, just before it is executed.

- Ahead-Of-Time Compilation (AOT):
    
    - A technique used by some languages to improve performance. The bytecode is compiled into machine code before it is executed.

- Cross-Compilation:
    
    - Compiling code on one type of computer so that it can be run on a different type of computer.

- Transpiler:
        
    - A program that translates code from one high-level language to another high-level language.

- All software must be translated  into the machine language that the computer understands before it can be executed.
