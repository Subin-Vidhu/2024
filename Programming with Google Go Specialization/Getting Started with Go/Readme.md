 - Why should you learn Go? 

    -  Advantages of Go:
        
        1. Code runs fast: 
        
            - Go is compiled to machine code, which makes it faster than interpreted languages like Python or Ruby.

        2. Garbage collection: 
        
            - Go has a garbage collector that automatically frees up memory that is no longer needed.
            
        3. Simpler Objects: 
        
            - Go has a simpler object model than languages like Java or C++. This makes it easier to learn and use.

        4. Concurrency is efficient: 
        
            - Go has built-in support for concurrency, which makes it easy to write programs that can do many things at once.
