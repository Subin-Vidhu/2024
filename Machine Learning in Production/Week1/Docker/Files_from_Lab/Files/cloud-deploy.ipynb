    "**IMPORTANT NOTE: Doing this optional lab requires an AWS Account and might incur compute costs. It will cost approximately 1 US Dollar to complete the exercise and serve your model for several hours. It will be much less (virtually free) if you terminate it quickly. If you opt to do this, please make sure to terminate the environment after the exercise to stop accumulating costs.**\n",

You will use [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) because of its easy setup. You will see your model API up and running in no time. Let's begin!"
