It will **require you to run the code in your local machine as this is not currently possible in the Coursera environment**. If you're already familiar with Docker or have some issues running the code here on your computer, feel free to skip this notebook and select the `cloud-deploy.ipynb` notebook in the file explorer on the left."

    "### Why Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is an amazing tool that allows you to **ship your software along with all of its dependencies**. This is great because it enables you to run software even without installing the required interpreters or compilers for it to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use an example to explain this better: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you trained a model using Python along with some libraries such as Tensorflow or JAX. For this, you created a virtual environment in your local machine. Everything works fine but now you want to share this model with a colleague who does not have Python installed, much less any of the required packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a pre-Docker world, your colleague would have to install all of this software just to run your model. Instead, by installing Docker, you can share a Docker image that includes all your software and that will be all that is needed."

    "### Some key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "You just read about Docker images and might be wondering what they are. Here are three key concepts to understand how Docker works. These are **Dockerfiles**, **images** and **containers**, and will be explained in this order as each one uses the one before it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dockerfile`: This is a special file that contains all of the instructions required to build an image. These instructions can be anything from \"install Python version 3.7\" to \"copy my code inside the image\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Image`: This refers to the collection of all your software in one single place. Using the previous example, the image will include Python, Tensorflow, JAX and your code. This will be achieved by setting the appropriate instructions within the Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Container`: This a running instance of an image. Images by themselves don't do much aside from saving the information of your code and its dependencies. You need to run a container out of them to actually run the code within. Containers are usually meant to perform a single task but they can be used as runtimes to run software that you haven't installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a high level idea of how Docker works, it is time for you to install it. If you already have it installed you can skip most of the following items."

    "If you are currently on a Windows machine, we recommend you install [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), in particular a Debian-based distribution such as **Ubuntu**. This will enable a real Linux kernel inside your Windows OS and will get full usage out of Docker and other command line tools you will be using such as [curl](https://curl.se/). **Machine learning deployment is usually done in Linux machines on the cloud so it is good that you get to know this OS for the purpose of deploying your models**.\n",
