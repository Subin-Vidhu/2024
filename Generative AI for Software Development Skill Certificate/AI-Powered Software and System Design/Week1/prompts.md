You are an expert on software design paradigms.I am working on building a simple Python-based app that will make calls to the DALL-E API and generateimages for users.

The application will be deployed in many different contexts andconfigurations depending on the end users, and want my less technicalcolleagues to be able to do some customization without editing the codeitself.

What high level software design paradigms should consider for this project?

You are a deep expert on the OpenAl ecosystem, including the client libraries, REST endpoints, and any other way of accessing functionality of GPT, DALL-E, and other models.

Please create easy to read, easy to follow code that will call DALL-E to generate an image. The code should be in Python, and all parameters should be in an external file that the Python codereads.

Please use the most up-to-date design pattern.
