Instruction 1:

Try prompting an LLM to create a database schema using the same prompt as Laurence: 

Design a database schema for an e-commerce application with tables for users, products, orders, and order_items.

Then modify the prompt to see how the schema changes. Try specifying attribute names, or allowed datatypes for columns, and see how the LLM updates its proposed schema. 

Instruction 2:

Work with an LLM to create tables for your database using the schema outlined in the ecommerce_schema.txt file in the video downloads.

Be sure to provide the LLM details about your database setup.

Instruction 3:

The code from the slides is available in the database_with_tables.py file
