    "\n",
    "## Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module you've been learning how LLMs can help with many common tasks when working with databases. In this assignment you'll have an opportunity to put those skills into practice. You will be working with a database designed to represent a simple social network. Here's the tasks you'll need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write code that reads data from a provided CSV file into the database\n",
    "2. Develop functions that query the database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission and Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will be graded based on four functions that you write. You can find starter code for all four functions below. Unit tests are provided to help you test your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPT-4o is available:** You can use whichever LLM you prefer on this assignment, but [GPT-4o has been made avaiable](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-powered-software-and-system-design/ungradedLab/rSPHu/gpt-4o-environment-for-assignment-to-use-alongside-the-programming-assignment) in the ungraded lab that follows this assignment\n",
    "- **Provide Context to Your LLM:** The LLM will need the context of the problem you're working on and the code already available to you in order to help develop solutions.\n",
    "- **Work Iteratively and Test as You Go:** Remember, the LLM's advice might not always be spot-on. It's up to you to decide what's useful, test the code it provides, and iterate as you work towards a solution."
