    "# Assignment 1 - Identifying and Fixing Bugs in Code Using an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment in the Generative AI for Software Development - Team Software Engineering course. In this assignment, you'll see several pieces of code containing bugs or issues. Your task is to identify and correct these errors. While it might be possible to debug each problem yourself, you'll find that using a large language model will help you tackle these challenges more efficiently, and might even bring up solutions you hadn't considered. This approach not only enhances your debugging skills but also introduces you to the practical applications of LLMs in software development. Get ready to sharpen your problem-solving abilities and delve into the world of code correction with an AI assistant by your side."

    "For each exercise, you will be provided with a function/class that is intended to work correctly, except for the last exercise, which will be discussed in due course. However, each function will contain a bug or inconsistency. Your task is to write a new function that performs the same task as the original one but with all identified bugs or issues resolved. You may ask an LLM to build unittests for you or even ask it to help you solving the exercise, it is up to you! Remember that you can also use the `unittests.py` file to debug what is going on and even using an LLM to help you in this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise comes with a set of constraints that you must adhere to. Failure to follow these guidelines will result in not passing the respective exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function or class requiring correction will be named, for example, `function_1`. You must write its improved version in the designated solution block, naming it `function_1_fixed`. **Do NOT** alter the function's parameters or name, as doing so will break autograder, resulting in a failure to pass the exercise.\n",

    "**FINAL INSTRUCTIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have doubts, you can prompt the LLM how to run your test cases\n",
    "- If you face runtime errors, you can prompt the LLM on how to fix the errors.\n",
    "- If you are failing in the unittests, you can open the unittests.py file and ask an LLM to explain to you the tests that are being performed.\n",

    "**IMPORTANT NOTES ON THE AUTOGRADING SYSTEM**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The graded cells are tagged, meaning the autograder specifically looks for them when grading. Therefore, **do not delete these cells or add your solution in another cell**, as this will cause the autograder to malfunction. If you accidentally delete a cell or encounter any unusual issues with the autograder, please [refresh your workspace](https://www.coursera.org/learn/team-software-engineering-with-ai/supplement/qEB8o/optional-downloading-your-notebook-and-refreshing-your-workspace) to obtain a new copy of the assignment and place your solution in the designated solution cells.\n",
    "- The autograder **does not have access** to the **unittests** library, so **avoid importing it or using any unittest functions within a graded cell**, as this will disrupt the autograder's functionality.\n",
    "- If you face any challenges or have questions about this assignment, feel free to [join our community](https://www.coursera.org/teach/team-software-engineering-with-ai/k6snBDf0Ee-9Ig7qA4dB5w/content/item/supplement/8E5g9) and seek assistance from our mentors!"
