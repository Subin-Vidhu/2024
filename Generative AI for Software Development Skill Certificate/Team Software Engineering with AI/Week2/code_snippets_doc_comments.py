    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

    This function uses the formula A = Ï€rÂ² to compute the area,

    of Ï€ is approximated as 3.14159.

    Parameters:
    radius (float): The radius of the circle. Must be a non-negative number.

    Returns:
    float: The area of the circle.

    Raises:

def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sort a list of elements using the bubble sort algorithm.

    This function is designed for developers who are familiar with 
    C++ or Java and are transitioning to Python. Bubble sort is a simple 
    sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares 
    adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
    The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

    Parameters:
    arr (list of int/float): A list of numerical values to be sorted.

    Returns:
    list of int/float: The sorted list of numbers in ascending order.

    Time Complexity:
    The worst-case and average time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2),
    where n is the number of elements in the list.

    Example:
    >>> bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90])
    [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

    Note:
    In Python, swapping elements is easily done using tuple unpacking 
    (arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]), which might be different 
    from the swap operations you are used to in C++ or Java.
