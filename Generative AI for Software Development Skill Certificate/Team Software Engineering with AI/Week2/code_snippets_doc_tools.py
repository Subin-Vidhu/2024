    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

    This function uses the formula A = πr² to compute the area of a circle,
    where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. The value of π is
    approximated as 3.14159.

    :param radius: The radius of the circle.
    :type radius: float
    :return: The area of the circle.
    :rtype: float

# As an expert in generating automatic documentation, can you help me set up Sphinx to generate documentation for the following python code? 

# Step 1: Install Sphinx
# First, you need to install Sphinx. You can do this using pip:

# bash
# Copy code

# pip install sphinx
# Step 2: Create a Sphinx Project
# Navigate to the root directory of your Python project and run the following command to initialize a Sphinx project:

# bash
# Copy code

# sphinx-quickstart
# This command will prompt you with several questions to configure your Sphinx project. You can accept the default values or customize them as needed. Key points include:

# Project name: Your project's name.
# Author name: Your name or your organization's name.
# Project version: The version of your project.
# Separate source and build directories: It's often useful to say "yes" to this for a cleaner structure.
# Step 3: Configure conf.py
# After running sphinx-quickstart, you'll have a conf.py file in your source directory. You need to configure it to include your Python modules. Open conf.py and modify the following:

# Add your project directory to sys.path:

# python
# Copy code

# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../your_project_directory'))
# Enable autodoc extension:

# Make sure the following line is in the extensions list:

# python
# Copy code

# extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
# Step 4: Create reStructuredText Files
# Create .rst files for your modules. You can manually create these or use sphinx-apidoc to automatically generate them:

# bash
# Copy code

# sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../your_project_directory
# This command generates .rst files for each module in your project.

# Step 5: Build the Documentation
# You can now build the HTML documentation. From the root of your Sphinx project, run:

# bash
# Copy code

# make html
# This will generate HTML documentation in the _build/html directory.

# Step 6: View the Documentation
# Open the index.html file in the _build/html directory in a web browser to view your generated documentation.

# Additional Tips
# Customize your index.rst: Edit index.rst to include your module documentation using .. toctree::.
# Use docstrings: Ensure your Python code has proper docstrings in ReST format for Sphinx to generate meaningful documentation.
# Explore themes: You can change the look of your documentation by configuring the html_theme option in conf.py.
