### Introduction to Clinical Data

##### Week 1

###### Introduction 

- The video is an introduction to the course "Introduction to Clinical Data" offered by Stanford University.
- The course covers a broad range of topics related to using data from the healthcare system to improve patient care.
- The video is presented by Professor Nigam Shah from Stanford University, along with Dr. Steve Bagley and David Magnus.
- The video starts by discussing the importance of understanding research questions and the data mining workflow to find answers.
- Different data sources available in the healthcare system are explored, along with the types of data and potential inaccuracies.
- The concept of a patient timeline view of data is introduced, which captures the time dimension of patient care records.
- A patient feature matrix is explained as a tabular view of data that forms the foundation for analysis.
- The transformation of unstructured healthcare data, such as text, images, and signals, into an analysis-ready matrix is discussed.
- The use of knowledge graphs to aid in this transformation is highlighted.
- Computational procedures for determining patient exposures and outcomes relevant to research questions are explained.
- Ethical issues related to using healthcare data to make decisions impacting patient care are addressed.
The course is designed to focus on understanding healthcare data and transforming it into analysis-ready datasets.
- The importance of data quality and knowledge is emphasized over specific algorithms.
- The video concludes by inviting learners to join the course and embark on a journey to explore electronic healthcare data.

- Definitions mentioned in the video:

    - Research questions: Questions that need to be answered using data analysis.
    - Data mining workflow: A systematic process of extracting knowledge or patterns from data.
    - Patient timeline view: A representation of patient care records that captures the time dimension.
    - Patient feature matrix: A tabular view of data that forms the foundation for analysis.
    - Knowledge graphs: Collections of prior biomedical knowledge used to aid in data transformation.
    - Exposures and outcomes: Factors or events that patients experience and are relevant to research questions.

###### Introduction to the data mining workflow

- The course aims to explain how clinical data can be used to answer research questions and improve patient and population health.
- The course follows a data mining workflow with four steps: posing a research question, identifying data sources, extracting and transforming the data, and conducting the analysis.
- Two representations of healthcare data are discussed: patient timelines and patient feature matrices.
- Patient timelines provide a chronological view of a patient's healthcare events and can be used to analyze patterns and trends.
- Patient feature matrices represent patients as rows and features as columns, allowing for analysis based on specific patient characteristics.
- The course covers different types of data available from healthcare systems, including structured and unstructured data.
- Processing and analysis methods are explored to extract insights from the data and answer research questions.
- The course also addresses potential problems and biases that can arise in clinical data analysis and ways to manage them.
- Ethical considerations in clinical data mining are discussed.
- The course focuses on steps one through three of the data mining workflow: posing research questions, finding relevant data, and preparing the data for analysis.

###### Real Life Example

- The video starts with an example of a teenager named Laura who has a chronic disease called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
- Laura recently had a flare-up of her condition and developed proteinuria, pancreatitis, and antiphospholipid antibodies in her blood.
- The video introduces the clinical question: Should a teenager with systemic lupus who develops proteinuria and has antiphospholipid antibodies receive an anticoagulant medication?
- The narrator explains that there are no published literature studies or general agreement among experts on how to treat such cases.
- To design a treatment plan for Laura, the video suggests examining what has happened to similar patients in the past.
- The data source for this analysis is the electronic medical record of a large academic medical center.
- The video highlights the importance of using clinical data mining to draw on all the relevant data in the electronic medical record.
- The video concludes by stating that the first two steps in the clinical data mining workflow have been completed: identifying the clinical question and the data source.
- Definitions mentioned in the video:

    - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): A chronic autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, brain, blood cells, and liver.
    - Proteinuria: The presence of an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, which can be a sign of kidney damage or disease.
    - Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas, which can cause severe abdominal pain and other symptoms.
    - Antiphospholipid antibodies: Antibodies that mistakenly attack normal proteins in the blood, leading to an increased risk of blood clots.
