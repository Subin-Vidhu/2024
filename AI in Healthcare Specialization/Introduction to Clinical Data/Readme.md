### Introduction to Clinical Data

##### Week 1

###### Introduction 

- The video is an introduction to the course "Introduction to Clinical Data" offered by Stanford University.
- The course covers a broad range of topics related to using data from the healthcare system to improve patient care.
- The video is presented by Professor Nigam Shah from Stanford University, along with Dr. Steve Bagley and David Magnus.
- The video starts by discussing the importance of understanding research questions and the data mining workflow to find answers.
- Different data sources available in the healthcare system are explored, along with the types of data and potential inaccuracies.
- The concept of a patient timeline view of data is introduced, which captures the time dimension of patient care records.
- A patient feature matrix is explained as a tabular view of data that forms the foundation for analysis.
- The transformation of unstructured healthcare data, such as text, images, and signals, into an analysis-ready matrix is discussed.
- The use of knowledge graphs to aid in this transformation is highlighted.
- Computational procedures for determining patient exposures and outcomes relevant to research questions are explained.
- Ethical issues related to using healthcare data to make decisions impacting patient care are addressed.
The course is designed to focus on understanding healthcare data and transforming it into analysis-ready datasets.
- The importance of data quality and knowledge is emphasized over specific algorithms.
- The video concludes by inviting learners to join the course and embark on a journey to explore electronic healthcare data.

- Definitions mentioned in the video:

    - Research questions: Questions that need to be answered using data analysis.
    - Data mining workflow: A systematic process of extracting knowledge or patterns from data.
    - Patient timeline view: A representation of patient care records that captures the time dimension.
    - Patient feature matrix: A tabular view of data that forms the foundation for analysis.
    - Knowledge graphs: Collections of prior biomedical knowledge used to aid in data transformation.
    - Exposures and outcomes: Factors or events that patients experience and are relevant to research questions.
