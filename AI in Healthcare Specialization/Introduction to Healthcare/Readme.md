###### Problem of Risk

- `Risk`: the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of using a particular healthcare service.

- The original transaction between patients and healthcare providers was a simple exchange of healthcare for compensation.
- Healthcare providers became increasingly able to offer valuable services to patients, leading to a greater need for access to professional healthcare.
- Healthcare also became more expensive as providers offered more sophisticated treatments.
- Patients faced the risk of large, unplanned medical bills that they may have trouble paying.
- This created discomfort for patients and affected their future willingness to use the healthcare system.
- Providers also faced challenges when patients couldn't afford the care they received, leading to unpaid bills.
- The problem of risk refers to the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of healthcare.
- Risk is common and widespread today, as healthcare costs can be significant and unpredictable.
- The problem of risk broke the original transaction and our ability to treat healthcare as a simple good or service.
- Addressing the problem of risk is crucial to ensure access to healthcare and the sustainability of healthcare providers.

###### Risk Pooling

- `Risk pooling`: sharing the risk among a group of people to reduce the financial impact of any one person's loss.

- Risk pooling is a solution to the problem of risk in healthcare systems.
- Risk pooling involves getting a group of people together to contribute an equal share to cover the medical bills of the group.
- By pooling the risk, individuals in the group share the costs of medical care, reducing their individual risk.
- Risk pooling helps replace uncertain and potentially large costs with more predictable and manageable costs.
- It involves shifting the risk from individuals to the group, which is collectively better positioned to handle it.
