### Introduction to Healthcare

##### Week 1

###### Introduction

- The course covers important topics in health care systems.
- It provides a broad overview of physician practices, hospitals, and other healthcare providers and facilities.
- The course discusses how we pay for health care services, health insurance, and government programs that cover health care.
- It also explores the topic of prescription drugs and healthcare quality and improvement.
- The course takes a survey approach, touching on key issues in each area without going into deep details.
- While the main focus is on the US healthcare system, the topics covered have relevance across multiple countries.
- The course aims to improve understanding of data generated by the healthcare system and its relation to innovations in artificial intelligence.
- Overall, the course provides a comprehensive orientation to the different aspects of health care delivery and financing.

###### Basic Structure of the Healthcare System

- The videos discuss the interaction between patients and healthcare providers in a healthcare system.
- The goal is to facilitate `healthcare flow` from providers to patients, including treatment, prevention, and information.
- Healthcare systems have evolved from simple interactions to modern systems that require compensation for providers.
- The videos explore the transition from simple transactions to complex healthcare systems.
- The videos highlight the importance of compensation for sustainable healthcare provision.

###### Problem of Risk

- `Risk`: the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of using a particular healthcare service.

- The original transaction between patients and healthcare providers was a simple exchange of healthcare for compensation.
- Healthcare providers became increasingly able to offer valuable services to patients, leading to a greater need for access to professional healthcare.
- Healthcare also became more expensive as providers offered more sophisticated treatments.
- Patients faced the risk of large, unplanned medical bills that they may have trouble paying.
- This created discomfort for patients and affected their future willingness to use the healthcare system.
- Providers also faced challenges when patients couldn't afford the care they received, leading to unpaid bills.
- The problem of risk refers to the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of healthcare.
- Risk is common and widespread today, as healthcare costs can be significant and unpredictable.
- The problem of risk broke the original transaction and our ability to treat healthcare as a simple good or service.
- Addressing the problem of risk is crucial to ensure access to healthcare and the sustainability of healthcare providers.

###### Risk Pooling

- `Risk pooling`: sharing the risk among a group of people to reduce the financial impact of any one person's loss.

- Risk pooling is a solution to the problem of risk in healthcare systems.
- Risk pooling involves getting a group of people together to contribute an equal share to cover the medical bills of the group.
- By pooling the risk, individuals in the group share the costs of medical care, reducing their individual risk.
- Risk pooling helps replace uncertain and potentially large costs with more predictable and manageable costs.
- It involves shifting the risk from individuals to the group, which is collectively better positioned to handle it.

###### Insurance and Intermediaries for Risk Pooling

- `Intermediaries`: entities that collect fund from a group of people, pool the funds, and uses them to pay for healthcare for people who are covered by the pool.
- 2 types of intermediaries:
    - `Private insurance companies`: sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
        - `Insurance Policy`: a contract that provides for paying the medical bills of the holder under certain conditions.

        - `Enrollees/ Members/ beneficiaries`: individuals covered by the insurance policy.

        - `Premium`: the price of the policy, paid by the enrollees.
    - `Government programs`: act as intermediaries by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.
- Risk pooling is a concept used to solve the problem of risk in healthcare delivery.
- Intermediaries are organizations that collect funds from a group of people, pool the funds, and use them to pay for healthcare for the covered individuals.
- Intermediaries can be private insurance companies, payers, or health plans.
- Insurance companies sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
- Enrollees or beneficiaries are the individuals covered by the insurance policy.
- Insurance policies are purchased through premiums, which are the price of the policy.
- Insurance companies pool the premiums collected from a large group of people to create a fund for paying medical bills.
- Government programs also act as intermediaries and pool risk by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.
- With intermediaries in the picture, funds flow from the population to the intermediaries, who then pay healthcare providers for providing care to the patients.
- Out-of-pocket payments and cost-sharing are still common in healthcare systems, even with insurance coverage.

- Difference between private insurance companies and government programs:
    - Private insurance companies: sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
    - Government programs: act as intermediaries by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.

    - Insurance companies sell insurance policies to their enrollees, who pay the insurance company a premium to be covered under that policy. Governments collect funds, either through the tax system or via a premium system, and use those funds to cover the health costs for a group of people.

###### Beyond Patients, Providers, and Intermediaries: Other Players in the Health Care System

- The healthcare system involves relationships between patients, providers, and intermediaries.
- Governments play a role in setting up and operating intermediaries, providing care, and regulating the healthcare system.
- Many companies provide goods and services used by providers and patients, such as drugs, devices, and data systems.
- Professional societies and organizations also work with providers and contribute to the healthcare system.
- Healthcare systems have various components, with a focus on intermediaries and providers, but other entities are also important.

###### Overview of the Types and Roles of Intermediaries

- Intermediaries play a crucial role in the healthcare system by pulling risk and managing the cost of care for their members.
Once intermediaries hold the risk, they have a fixed pool of money collected from premiums and are responsible if their members require a lot of care.
- Intermediaries have an interest in influencing the care their members receive to manage costs in a responsible way and retain customers.
- Different intermediaries may have varying approaches to managing care, such as HMOs, PPOs, and high deductible health plans.
- Intermediaries can be used in various combinations in different countries, and there is no single intermediary that covers everyone.
- Some intermediaries may serve specific populations or geographic areas, while others offer multiple choices for individuals to opt for.
- Examples include the Medicare program in the US for people over 65, the National Health Service in the UK, and private insurance options in both countries.

- The second video provides an overview of the different types of providers in the healthcare system.
- It categorizes providers into two groups: medical professionals and organizations.
- Medical professionals include physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other specialized professionals.
- Physicians have focused training in a particular area of medicine and work in outpatient or inpatient settings.
- Nurses play an essential role in providing care and often work as part of a team with physicians.
- Other professionals in the healthcare system include optometrists, midwives, pharmacists, dentists, therapists, and emergency medical providers.
- Organizations in the healthcare system include physician practices, hospitals, and independent facilities.
- Physician practices provide administrative and physical infrastructure for outpatient care.
- Hospitals provide more complex care for inpatients and have facilities for surgeries and advanced testing.
- Independent facilities include laboratories, ambulatory surgery facilities, diagnostic imaging facilities, pharmacies, rehabilitation facilities, and long-term care facilities.
- These organizations can be owned and operated by governments or privately owned.
- In some systems, physicians and facilities are organized separately, while in others they may be more closely integrated.
The video emphasizes the importance of collaboration between medical professionals and organizations in delivering care.

- Some key definitions:

    - Specialty: Physicians often have focused training in a particular area of medicine, which is referred to as their specialty. Examples of specialties include internist, pediatrician, cardiologist, and thoracic surgeon. Physicians are often referred to by their specialty, as it indicates their area of expertise.

    - Outpatient: Outpatient settings refer to healthcare settings that are outside of a hospital. Examples include physician offices, clinics, and surgical centers. In outpatient care, patients come in, see a provider, receive any necessary consultation or treatment, and then go back home on the same day.

    - Inpatient: Inpatient care refers to healthcare provided to patients in hospitals. Patients needing inpatient care are admitted to the hospital, stay there for a period of time to receive care, and then go home when they are done.

    - Nurse Practitioner: Nurse practitioners are advanced practice registered nurses who have additional training and education beyond that of a registered nurse. They can provide a wide range of healthcare services, including diagnosing and treating illnesses, prescribing medications, and managing overall patient care.

    - Physician Assistant: Physician assistants are healthcare professionals who work under the supervision of physicians. They can perform various tasks, such as taking medical histories, conducting physical examinations, ordering and interpreting diagnostic tests, and assisting in surgeries.

    - Specialty Providers: In addition to physicians, there are other professionals with specialized expertise who provide care in specific areas. Examples include optometrists (eye care), midwives (maternity care), pharmacists (medication management), dentists (oral health), therapists (mental health), and emergency medical providers (emergency care).

    - Physician Practices: Physician practices are organizations within which physicians work. They provide the administrative and physical infrastructure that physicians need to deliver care. This includes rooms, equipment, and support staff like nurses and scheduling/billing personnel. Physician practices mainly focus on providing infrastructure for outpatient care.

    - Hospitals: Hospitals are organizations that provide more complex care for inpatients. They have facilities such as beds, surgical suites, advanced testing and imaging equipment, and specialized departments. Hospitals also employ a range of medical professionals, including nurses, to provide care to patients.

    - Independent Organizations: These are organizations that provide facilities for specific types of medical care but are not part of a physician practice or a hospital. Examples include laboratories for diagnostic testing, ambulatory surgery facilities, diagnostic imaging facilities, pharmacies, rehabilitation facilities, and long-term care facilities. These organizations can operate independently in the community or be associated with hospitals or physician practices.

    - For-Profit and Nonprofit Organizations: Healthcare organizations can be owned and operated under different arrangements. In some systems, such as the United States, organizations like physician practices, hospitals, and independent facilities are privately owned and operated separately from the government. They function like businesses, providing care in exchange for compensation. Some organizations are explicitly for-profit, aiming to earn profits for their owners, while others may be nonprofit with a broader mission beyond earning profits. Nonprofits still need to be economically successful to stay in operation.

    - Integration of Physicians and Facilities: In some healthcare systems, physicians or physician practices and facilities like hospitals are organized separately but work closely together. For example, in the US, a physician may provide medical care while the hospital provides the facilities. In other systems, there may be closer integration, with the hospital employing physicians and providing both facilities and physician services within the same organization.

###### Providers and Levels of Care

- The first level is primary care, which is the initial and most generalized care a patient receives.
    - Primary care providers treat a wide range of general conditions and can refer patients to specialized physicians if needed.
    - Primary care is often provided by physicians in specialties like general practice, family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics, or obstetrics and gynecology.
    - Primary care can also be provided by nurse practitioners or physician assistants.
- The next level is secondary care, which is for less common and more complex conditions that require specialized treatment.
    - Physicians providing secondary care are often called specialists or consultants.
    - Secondary care can be provided in outpatient settings or in hospitals.
- The third level is tertiary care, which involves even more specialized care and advanced treatments.
    - Tertiary care is less commonly needed than secondary care and is associated with inpatient care.
    - Tertiary care is provided by highly specialized physicians in referral centers with advanced technologies.
- The fourth level, quaternary care, is an extension of tertiary care and involves very advanced and experimental treatments.
    - Quaternary care is associated with large, advanced hospitals and academic institutions.
