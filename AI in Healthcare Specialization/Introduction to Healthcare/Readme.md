### Introduction to Healthcare

##### Week 1

###### Introduction

- The course covers important topics in health care systems.
- It provides a broad overview of physician practices, hospitals, and other healthcare providers and facilities.
- The course discusses how we pay for health care services, health insurance, and government programs that cover health care.
- It also explores the topic of prescription drugs and healthcare quality and improvement.
- The course takes a survey approach, touching on key issues in each area without going into deep details.
- While the main focus is on the US healthcare system, the topics covered have relevance across multiple countries.
- The course aims to improve understanding of data generated by the healthcare system and its relation to innovations in artificial intelligence.
- Overall, the course provides a comprehensive orientation to the different aspects of health care delivery and financing.

###### Basic Structure of the Healthcare System

- The videos discuss the interaction between patients and healthcare providers in a healthcare system.
- The goal is to facilitate `healthcare flow` from providers to patients, including treatment, prevention, and information.
- Healthcare systems have evolved from simple interactions to modern systems that require compensation for providers.
- The videos explore the transition from simple transactions to complex healthcare systems.
- The videos highlight the importance of compensation for sustainable healthcare provision.

###### Problem of Risk

- `Risk`: the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of using a particular healthcare service.

- The original transaction between patients and healthcare providers was a simple exchange of healthcare for compensation.
- Healthcare providers became increasingly able to offer valuable services to patients, leading to a greater need for access to professional healthcare.
- Healthcare also became more expensive as providers offered more sophisticated treatments.
- Patients faced the risk of large, unplanned medical bills that they may have trouble paying.
- This created discomfort for patients and affected their future willingness to use the healthcare system.
- Providers also faced challenges when patients couldn't afford the care they received, leading to unpaid bills.
- The problem of risk refers to the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of healthcare.
- Risk is common and widespread today, as healthcare costs can be significant and unpredictable.
- The problem of risk broke the original transaction and our ability to treat healthcare as a simple good or service.
- Addressing the problem of risk is crucial to ensure access to healthcare and the sustainability of healthcare providers.

###### Risk Pooling

- `Risk pooling`: sharing the risk among a group of people to reduce the financial impact of any one person's loss.

- Risk pooling is a solution to the problem of risk in healthcare systems.
- Risk pooling involves getting a group of people together to contribute an equal share to cover the medical bills of the group.
- By pooling the risk, individuals in the group share the costs of medical care, reducing their individual risk.
- Risk pooling helps replace uncertain and potentially large costs with more predictable and manageable costs.
- It involves shifting the risk from individuals to the group, which is collectively better positioned to handle it.

###### Insurance and Intermediaries for Risk Pooling

- `Intermediaries`: entities that collect fund from a group of people, pool the funds, and uses them to pay for healthcare for people who are covered by the pool.
- 2 types of intermediaries:
    - `Private insurance companies`: sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
        - `Insurance Policy`: a contract that provides for paying the medical bills of the holder under certain conditions.

        - `Enrollees/ Members/ beneficiaries`: individuals covered by the insurance policy.

        - `Premium`: the price of the policy, paid by the enrollees.
    - `Government programs`: act as intermediaries by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.
- Risk pooling is a concept used to solve the problem of risk in healthcare delivery.
- Intermediaries are organizations that collect funds from a group of people, pool the funds, and use them to pay for healthcare for the covered individuals.
- Intermediaries can be private insurance companies, payers, or health plans.
- Insurance companies sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
- Enrollees or beneficiaries are the individuals covered by the insurance policy.
- Insurance policies are purchased through premiums, which are the price of the policy.
- Insurance companies pool the premiums collected from a large group of people to create a fund for paying medical bills.
- Government programs also act as intermediaries and pool risk by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.
- With intermediaries in the picture, funds flow from the population to the intermediaries, who then pay healthcare providers for providing care to the patients.
- Out-of-pocket payments and cost-sharing are still common in healthcare systems, even with insurance coverage.

- Difference between private insurance companies and government programs:
    - Private insurance companies: sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
    - Government programs: act as intermediaries by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.

    - Insurance companies sell insurance policies to their enrollees, who pay the insurance company a premium to be covered under that policy. Governments collect funds, either through the tax system or via a premium system, and use those funds to cover the health costs for a group of people.

###### Beyond Patients, Providers, and Intermediaries: Other Players in the Health Care System

- The healthcare system involves relationships between patients, providers, and intermediaries.
- Governments play a role in setting up and operating intermediaries, providing care, and regulating the healthcare system.
- Many companies provide goods and services used by providers and patients, such as drugs, devices, and data systems.
- Professional societies and organizations also work with providers and contribute to the healthcare system.
- Healthcare systems have various components, with a focus on intermediaries and providers, but other entities are also important.

###### Overview of the Types and Roles of Intermediaries

- Intermediaries play a crucial role in the healthcare system by pulling risk and managing the cost of care for their members.
Once intermediaries hold the risk, they have a fixed pool of money collected from premiums and are responsible if their members require a lot of care.
- Intermediaries have an interest in influencing the care their members receive to manage costs in a responsible way and retain customers.
- Different intermediaries may have varying approaches to managing care, such as HMOs, PPOs, and high deductible health plans.
- Intermediaries can be used in various combinations in different countries, and there is no single intermediary that covers everyone.
- Some intermediaries may serve specific populations or geographic areas, while others offer multiple choices for individuals to opt for.
- Examples include the Medicare program in the US for people over 65, the National Health Service in the UK, and private insurance options in both countries.
