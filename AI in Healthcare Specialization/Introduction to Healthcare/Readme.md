### Introduction to Healthcare

##### Week 1

###### Introduction

- The course covers important topics in health care systems.
- It provides a broad overview of physician practices, hospitals, and other healthcare providers and facilities.
- The course discusses how we pay for health care services, health insurance, and government programs that cover health care.
- It also explores the topic of prescription drugs and healthcare quality and improvement.
- The course takes a survey approach, touching on key issues in each area without going into deep details.
- While the main focus is on the US healthcare system, the topics covered have relevance across multiple countries.
- The course aims to improve understanding of data generated by the healthcare system and its relation to innovations in artificial intelligence.
- Overall, the course provides a comprehensive orientation to the different aspects of health care delivery and financing.

###### Basic Structure of the Healthcare System

- The videos discuss the interaction between patients and healthcare providers in a healthcare system.
- The goal is to facilitate `healthcare flow` from providers to patients, including treatment, prevention, and information.
- Healthcare systems have evolved from simple interactions to modern systems that require compensation for providers.
- The videos explore the transition from simple transactions to complex healthcare systems.
- The videos highlight the importance of compensation for sustainable healthcare provision.

###### Problem of Risk

- `Risk`: the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of using a particular healthcare service.

- The original transaction between patients and healthcare providers was a simple exchange of healthcare for compensation.
- Healthcare providers became increasingly able to offer valuable services to patients, leading to a greater need for access to professional healthcare.
- Healthcare also became more expensive as providers offered more sophisticated treatments.
- Patients faced the risk of large, unplanned medical bills that they may have trouble paying.
- This created discomfort for patients and affected their future willingness to use the healthcare system.
- Providers also faced challenges when patients couldn't afford the care they received, leading to unpaid bills.
- The problem of risk refers to the possibility of facing a financial loss associated with the use of healthcare.
- Risk is common and widespread today, as healthcare costs can be significant and unpredictable.
- The problem of risk broke the original transaction and our ability to treat healthcare as a simple good or service.
- Addressing the problem of risk is crucial to ensure access to healthcare and the sustainability of healthcare providers.

###### Risk Pooling

- `Risk pooling`: sharing the risk among a group of people to reduce the financial impact of any one person's loss.

- Risk pooling is a solution to the problem of risk in healthcare systems.
- Risk pooling involves getting a group of people together to contribute an equal share to cover the medical bills of the group.
- By pooling the risk, individuals in the group share the costs of medical care, reducing their individual risk.
- Risk pooling helps replace uncertain and potentially large costs with more predictable and manageable costs.
- It involves shifting the risk from individuals to the group, which is collectively better positioned to handle it.

###### Insurance and Intermediaries for Risk Pooling

- `Intermediaries`: entities that collect fund from a group of people, pool the funds, and uses them to pay for healthcare for people who are covered by the pool.
- 2 types of intermediaries:
    - `Private insurance companies`: sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
        - `Insurance Policy`: a contract that provides for paying the medical bills of the holder under certain conditions.

        - `Enrollees/ Members/ beneficiaries`: individuals covered by the insurance policy.

        - `Premium`: the price of the policy, paid by the enrollees.
    - `Government programs`: act as intermediaries by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.
- Risk pooling is a concept used to solve the problem of risk in healthcare delivery.
- Intermediaries are organizations that collect funds from a group of people, pool the funds, and use them to pay for healthcare for the covered individuals.
- Intermediaries can be private insurance companies, payers, or health plans.
- Insurance companies sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
- Enrollees or beneficiaries are the individuals covered by the insurance policy.
- Insurance policies are purchased through premiums, which are the price of the policy.
- Insurance companies pool the premiums collected from a large group of people to create a fund for paying medical bills.
- Government programs also act as intermediaries and pool risk by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.
- With intermediaries in the picture, funds flow from the population to the intermediaries, who then pay healthcare providers for providing care to the patients.
- Out-of-pocket payments and cost-sharing are still common in healthcare systems, even with insurance coverage.

- Difference between private insurance companies and government programs:
    - Private insurance companies: sell health insurance policies that provide coverage for medical bills under certain conditions.
    - Government programs: act as intermediaries by collecting funds from the population to finance healthcare costs.

    - Insurance companies sell insurance policies to their enrollees, who pay the insurance company a premium to be covered under that policy. Governments collect funds, either through the tax system or via a premium system, and use those funds to cover the health costs for a group of people.

###### Beyond Patients, Providers, and Intermediaries: Other Players in the Health Care System

- The healthcare system involves relationships between patients, providers, and intermediaries.
- Governments play a role in setting up and operating intermediaries, providing care, and regulating the healthcare system.
- Many companies provide goods and services used by providers and patients, such as drugs, devices, and data systems.
- Professional societies and organizations also work with providers and contribute to the healthcare system.
- Healthcare systems have various components, with a focus on intermediaries and providers, but other entities are also important.

###### Overview of the Types and Roles of Intermediaries

- Intermediaries play a crucial role in the healthcare system by pulling risk and managing the cost of care for their members.
Once intermediaries hold the risk, they have a fixed pool of money collected from premiums and are responsible if their members require a lot of care.
- Intermediaries have an interest in influencing the care their members receive to manage costs in a responsible way and retain customers.
- Different intermediaries may have varying approaches to managing care, such as HMOs, PPOs, and high deductible health plans.
- Intermediaries can be used in various combinations in different countries, and there is no single intermediary that covers everyone.
- Some intermediaries may serve specific populations or geographic areas, while others offer multiple choices for individuals to opt for.
- Examples include the Medicare program in the US for people over 65, the National Health Service in the UK, and private insurance options in both countries.

- The second video provides an overview of the different types of providers in the healthcare system.
- It categorizes providers into two groups: medical professionals and organizations.
- Medical professionals include physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other specialized professionals.
- Physicians have focused training in a particular area of medicine and work in outpatient or inpatient settings.
- Nurses play an essential role in providing care and often work as part of a team with physicians.
- Other professionals in the healthcare system include optometrists, midwives, pharmacists, dentists, therapists, and emergency medical providers.
- Organizations in the healthcare system include physician practices, hospitals, and independent facilities.
- Physician practices provide administrative and physical infrastructure for outpatient care.
- Hospitals provide more complex care for inpatients and have facilities for surgeries and advanced testing.
- Independent facilities include laboratories, ambulatory surgery facilities, diagnostic imaging facilities, pharmacies, rehabilitation facilities, and long-term care facilities.
- These organizations can be owned and operated by governments or privately owned.
- In some systems, physicians and facilities are organized separately, while in others they may be more closely integrated.
The video emphasizes the importance of collaboration between medical professionals and organizations in delivering care.

- Some key definitions:

    - Specialty: Physicians often have focused training in a particular area of medicine, which is referred to as their specialty. Examples of specialties include internist, pediatrician, cardiologist, and thoracic surgeon. Physicians are often referred to by their specialty, as it indicates their area of expertise.

    - Outpatient: Outpatient settings refer to healthcare settings that are outside of a hospital. Examples include physician offices, clinics, and surgical centers. In outpatient care, patients come in, see a provider, receive any necessary consultation or treatment, and then go back home on the same day.

    - Inpatient: Inpatient care refers to healthcare provided to patients in hospitals. Patients needing inpatient care are admitted to the hospital, stay there for a period of time to receive care, and then go home when they are done.

    - Nurse Practitioner: Nurse practitioners are advanced practice registered nurses who have additional training and education beyond that of a registered nurse. They can provide a wide range of healthcare services, including diagnosing and treating illnesses, prescribing medications, and managing overall patient care.

    - Physician Assistant: Physician assistants are healthcare professionals who work under the supervision of physicians. They can perform various tasks, such as taking medical histories, conducting physical examinations, ordering and interpreting diagnostic tests, and assisting in surgeries.

    - Specialty Providers: In addition to physicians, there are other professionals with specialized expertise who provide care in specific areas. Examples include optometrists (eye care), midwives (maternity care), pharmacists (medication management), dentists (oral health), therapists (mental health), and emergency medical providers (emergency care).

    - Physician Practices: Physician practices are organizations within which physicians work. They provide the administrative and physical infrastructure that physicians need to deliver care. This includes rooms, equipment, and support staff like nurses and scheduling/billing personnel. Physician practices mainly focus on providing infrastructure for outpatient care.

    - Hospitals: Hospitals are organizations that provide more complex care for inpatients. They have facilities such as beds, surgical suites, advanced testing and imaging equipment, and specialized departments. Hospitals also employ a range of medical professionals, including nurses, to provide care to patients.

    - Independent Organizations: These are organizations that provide facilities for specific types of medical care but are not part of a physician practice or a hospital. Examples include laboratories for diagnostic testing, ambulatory surgery facilities, diagnostic imaging facilities, pharmacies, rehabilitation facilities, and long-term care facilities. These organizations can operate independently in the community or be associated with hospitals or physician practices.

    - For-Profit and Nonprofit Organizations: Healthcare organizations can be owned and operated under different arrangements. In some systems, such as the United States, organizations like physician practices, hospitals, and independent facilities are privately owned and operated separately from the government. They function like businesses, providing care in exchange for compensation. Some organizations are explicitly for-profit, aiming to earn profits for their owners, while others may be nonprofit with a broader mission beyond earning profits. Nonprofits still need to be economically successful to stay in operation.

    - Integration of Physicians and Facilities: In some healthcare systems, physicians or physician practices and facilities like hospitals are organized separately but work closely together. For example, in the US, a physician may provide medical care while the hospital provides the facilities. In other systems, there may be closer integration, with the hospital employing physicians and providing both facilities and physician services within the same organization.

###### Providers and Levels of Care

- The first level is primary care, which is the initial and most generalized care a patient receives.
    - Primary care providers treat a wide range of general conditions and can refer patients to specialized physicians if needed.
    - Primary care is often provided by physicians in specialties like general practice, family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics, or obstetrics and gynecology.
    - Primary care can also be provided by nurse practitioners or physician assistants.
- The next level is secondary care, which is for less common and more complex conditions that require specialized treatment.
    - Physicians providing secondary care are often called specialists or consultants.
    - Secondary care can be provided in outpatient settings or in hospitals.
- The third level is tertiary care, which involves even more specialized care and advanced treatments.
    - Tertiary care is less commonly needed than secondary care and is associated with inpatient care.
    - Tertiary care is provided by highly specialized physicians in referral centers with advanced technologies.
- The fourth level, quaternary care, is an extension of tertiary care and involves very advanced and experimental treatments.
    - Quaternary care is associated with large, advanced hospitals and academic institutions.

##### The Challenge of Rising Health Care Costs

- The video discusses the challenges in the healthcare system that drive discussions about policies and business opportunities.
- Healthcare costs are high and continue to grow over time in many countries.
- Healthcare spending as a percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) is used as a measure of healthcare expense.
- Most countries spend a significant amount on healthcare, with some countries, like the US, having higher spending than others.
- The increase in healthcare costs can be attributed to factors such as an aging population, increased population incomes, price increases, and advances in technology.
- The high and rising costs raise questions about the value of healthcare and the fairness of prices.
- There is a need to eliminate waste and improve value in healthcare systems.
- Intermediaries, such as private insurers and governments, play a role in managing costs.
- Healthcare providers and individual patients also have a stake in managing healthcare services and costs.
- Questions about healthcare spending and costs will continue to drive discussions and the need for innovation and ideas.

###### The Challenges of Quality and Access

- The video discusses the challenge of improving quality in healthcare systems.
- Healthcare is complex and rapidly changing, making it difficult to provide high-quality care.
- Underuse, overuse, and misuse of services are common challenges in healthcare.
    - `Underuse`: People don’t use enough of a beneficial service (e.g. vaccines).

    - `Overuse`: Services that only have value for some patients are used by others as well (e.g. MRI scans are given to every person who comes to the emergency department for back pain).

    - `Misuse`: Giving a patient a service when it is not indicated (e.g. giving blood thinners to patient in whom they are contraindicated).
- Providers and the healthcare system are motivated to improve quality and address these challenges.
- Efforts to monitor care, create data, and design better systems are being made to improve quality.
- Access to care and coverage is another challenge in healthcare systems.
- Socioeconomic disparities, cultural issues, and lack of providers can contribute to access challenges.
- Participants in the healthcare system are interested in finding approaches to improve access.
- The video highlights the opportunities for improvement in quality and access in healthcare systems.

###### Lessons for AI and Data

- The video starts by discussing the wide variety of players in the healthcare system and the different roles they play. It emphasizes that when working on AI and healthcare, it is important to consider the different parts of the healthcare system and what they might want from AI.
- Intermediaries, such as insurance companies, have a population to manage and are looking for tools that can help them identify possible health issues in their population and provide access to necessary resources.
- Providers, such as physicians, are focused on providing healthcare to their patients. They need tools that can help them manage incoming information, diagnose and create treatment plans, and identify patients who may need services in the future.
- Patients themselves have interests in keeping themselves healthy and may want to find out if they need medical care. Patient-directed solutions can be beneficial in this regard.
- The video then shifts its focus to the data aspect of healthcare. 
- Different entities in the healthcare system have different kinds of data.
- Providers often have data from their work with patients, which is stored in electronic health records (EHRs). EHR data can be useful but may have idiosyncrasies, such as text fields that are not always easy to handle and less information on payments or business matters.
- Intermediaries, on the other hand, have data associated with paying providers. This data can provide insights into where patients are receiving services and how much they cost.
- Governments, as regulators of the healthcare system, keep track of licensed hospitals and physician licenses. Other entities, such as pharmacies, may also collect data on the drugs they sell.
- The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of paying attention to the fact that data in healthcare comes from different sources, is used for different reasons, and has different issues. It highlights the need for innovation, new ideas, processes, and technologies to address the challenges in the healthcare system.

##### Week 2

###### Characteristics of Physician Practices

- The video discusses how physicians provide services and the organizations in which they work, known as physician practices.
- Physician practices can be organized in different ways, such as independent entities or government-owned.
- Practices can vary in size, from solo practices with one physician to large practices with hundreds or even thousands of physicians.
- As practices get larger, they may be called medical groups or physician organizations.
- Ownership structures also change with practice size, with smaller practices commonly owned by physicians and larger practices having more complex ownership structures.
- Management and staffing also differ based on practice size, with larger practices having more resources and elaborate management structures.
- Larger practices often have multi-specialty physicians and may offer in-house services like imaging and laboratory services.
- Some practices have multiple locations, serving different communities.
- Understanding the variety of physician practices helps in understanding different ways medical care is delivered and how physicians interact with intermediaries and the flow of funds in healthcare systems.

###### Physicians, Intermediaries, and Networks

- The video discusses the role of intermediaries in the healthcare system and how they facilitate the flow of funds between patients and providers.
- Intermediaries: Organizations that have agreements with physician practices to provide care to their enrollees and handle payment arrangements.
- Physician Practices: Privately run practices that have arrangements or agreements with intermediaries to provide care to patients and receive payment.
- Physician Networks: A particular set of physicians or practices with whom insurers work, and which the members covered by the insurer will be encouraged or required to see for covered care.
- In-Network: Physicians or practices that have negotiated an arrangement with an insurer to be part of their network, allowing the insurer to cover or contribute to the cost of their care for the insurer's members.
- Out-of-Network: Physicians or practices that do not have an arrangement with a particular insurer, making it more difficult for the insurer's members to use their services.
- Independent Practice Associations (IPAs): Organizations that help smaller practices by organizing them into a network and negotiating agreements with insurers on their behalf.
- Payment Arrangements: Terms and agreements between intermediaries and physician practices regarding the payment for services provided to patients.
- Size and Structure of Practices: The size and management structure of physician practices can influence the negotiation and arrangement process with intermediaries.
- Contracting Directly: Some practices may choose to negotiate agreements directly with insurers instead of going through an IPA or other network organizer.
