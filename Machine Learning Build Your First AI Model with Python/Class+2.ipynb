    "Once we import the `train_test_split` function, we can use it to split our dataset into training and testing subsets. The function takes several parameters, including the dataset (features and target variables) and the desired size or proportion of the testing set. It randomly shuffles the data and splits it into two parts based on the specified pde model's performance.\r\n",
