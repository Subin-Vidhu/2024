    "We are importing the `datasets` module from the `sklearn` library.\r\n",

    "`sklearn` is short for scikit-learn, which is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides a wide range of tools and algorithms for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and more.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The `datasets` module within scikit-learn contains various pre-loaded datasets that are commonly used for practicing and learning machine learning algorithms. These datasets are conveniently packaged and can be easily accessed for experimentation and model training.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By importing the `datasets` module, we gain access to these pre-loaded datasets, making it easier to work with them in our code. We can use these datasets to train and evaluate machine learning models, test algorithms, and explore different techniques without the need to manually load or preprocess the data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Once we import the `datasets` module, we can use functions like `load_iris()`, `load_digits()`, or `load_boston()` to load specific dn tasks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In summary, the line `from sklearn import datasets` allows us to import the `datasets` module from the scikit-learn library, giving us access to pre-loaded datasets that we can use for machine learning experimentation and training."
