    - single feature

    - multiple features

    - Neural Network can learn complex patterns and create new features by itself where as in traditional machine learning we have to manually create features(feature engineering).

- Multiple hidden layers

    - How many neurons and how many hidden layers is a question of the architecture of the neural network.*
