- Learning Process

    - How to choose what feature to split on at each node?

        - Greedy algorithm: At each node, choose the feature that maximizes the information gain.

        - Information gain: The reduction in entropy after a dataset is split on an attribute.

        - Entropy: The measure of randomness or uncertainty in a dataset.

        - Information gain = entropy(parent) - [weighted average]entropy(children)

        - Entropy = -Î£p(x)log2p(x)

        - p(x) = fraction of examples in class x

    - When do you stop splitting?

        - When all data points belong to the same class.

        - When all data points belong to the same feature value.

        - When the tree reaches a maximum depth.

        - When the number of data points is less than a threshold.

- Measuring Purity

    - Entropy: The measure of randomness or uncertainty in a dataset, ie measure of impurity of a set of data points.

- Continous valued features

    - Carry out the usual information gain calculation and decide to split on the continous feature value that gives the maximum information gain.

- Regression Trees

    - Instead of predicting a class label, we predict a continuous value.

    - The prediction is the average of the target values of the data points in the leaf node.

    - The split is decided based on the variance of the target values.
