Madrid, as Spain's capital and largest city, is a key player in the nation's economy. Historically centered around its administrative functions, Madrid has evolved into a major financial hub, hosting the Madrid Stock Exchange and the headquarters of numerous national and international companies.

The service sector, especially tourism, is vital to Madrid's economy. Millions of tourists visit annually, attracted by the city's cultural landmarks, museums, and vibrant nightlife. Additionally, trade fairs and conferences at venues like IFEMA (Feria de Madrid) bring significant business traffic.

Innovation and technology are also growing sectors in Madrid. The city boasts a thriving startup ecosystem and hosts many tech companies, supported by a highly educated workforce from its universities and research institutions. This has spurred growth in IT, biotechnology, and renewable energy.

Madrid's well-developed transportation network, including a comprehensive metro system, high-speed rail, and Adolfo Su√°rez Madrid-Barajas Airport, enhances its role as a logistical and commercial hub. This connectivity supports trade and commerce, both within Spain and internationally, solidifying Madrid's status as a leading economic center in Europe.
