"""Prompt compression
Prompt compression is a strategy falling under the broader category of optimizing prompts. Your goal is to reduce costs while keeping the response as good as possible. The LLM that you are using charges based on token count."""

"""Mitigation strategies

For each mitigation strategy, figure out which threat it aims to tackle: prompt injection, data poisoning, or denial-of-service."""
