"""Importing flat files from the web: your turn!
You are about to import your first file from the web! The flat file you will import will be 'winequality-red.csv' from the University of California, Irvine's Machine Learning repository. The flat file contains tabular data of physiochemical properties of red wine, such as pH, alcohol content and citric acid content, along with wine quality rating.

The URL of the file is

'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'
After you import it, you'll check your working directory to confirm that it is there and then you'll load it into a pandas DataFrame."""

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Save file locally
urlretrieve(url, 'winequality-red.csv')

# Read file into a DataFrame and print its head
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
print(df.head())

"""Opening and reading flat files from the web
You have just imported a file from the web, saved it locally and loaded it into a DataFrame. If you just wanted to load a file from the web into a DataFrame without first saving it locally, you can do that easily using pandas. In particular, you can use the function pd.read_csv() with the URL as the first argument and the separator sep as the second argument.

The URL of the file, once again, is

'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'"""

"""Importing non-flat files from the web
Congrats! You've just loaded a flat file from the web into a DataFrame without first saving it locally using the pandas function pd.read_csv(). This function is super cool because it has close relatives that allow you to load all types of files, not only flat ones. In this interactive exercise, you'll use pd.read_excel() to import an Excel spreadsheet.

The URL of the spreadsheet is

'https://assets.datacamp.com/course/importing_data_into_r/latitude.xls'
Your job is to use pd.read_excel() to read in all of its sheets, print the sheet names and then print the head of the first sheet using its name, not its index.

Note that the output of pd.read_excel() is a Python dictionary with sheet names as keys and corresponding DataFrames as corresponding values."""

# Import package
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/course/importing_data_into_r/latitude.xls'

# Print the sheetnames to the shell
print(xls.keys())

# Print the head of the first sheet (using its name, NOT its index)
print(xls['1700'].head())

"""Performing HTTP requests in Python using urllib
Now that you know the basics behind HTTP GET requests, it's time to perform some of your own. In this interactive exercise, you will ping our very own DataCamp servers to perform a GET request to extract information from the first coding exercise of this course, "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2".

In the next exercise, you'll extract the HTML itself. Right now, however, you are going to package and send the request and then catch the response."""

You have just packaged and sent a GET request to "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2" and then caught the response. You saw that such a response is a http.client.HTTPResponse object. The question remains: what can you do with this response?

Well, as it came from an HTML page, you could read it to extract the HTML and, in fact, such a http.client.HTTPResponse object has an associated read() method. In this exercise, you'll build on your previous great work to extract the response and print the HTML."""

In this interactive exercise, you'll learn how to use the BeautifulSoup package to parse, prettify and extract information from HTML. You'll scrape the data from the webpage of Guido van Rossum, Python's very own Benevolent Dictator for Life.
