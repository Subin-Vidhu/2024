Now that you've got your Twitter data sitting locally in a text file, it's time to explore it! This is what you'll do in the next few interactive exercises. In this exercise, you'll read the Twitter data into a list: tweets_data.

Now you have the Twitter data in a list of dictionaries, tweets_data, where each dictionary corresponds to a single tweet. Next, you're going to extract the text and language of each tweet.

Now that you have your DataFrame of tweets set up, you're going to do a bit of text analysis to count how many tweets contain the words 'clinton', 'trump', 'sanders' and 'cruz'.

"""Plotting your Twitter data
Now that you have the number of tweets that each candidate was mentioned in, you can plot a bar chart of this data. You'll use the statistical data visualization library seaborn, which you may not have seen before, but we'll guide you through. You'll first import seaborn as sns. You'll then construct a barplot of the data using sns.barplot, passing it two arguments:

a list of labels and
a list containing the variables you wish to plot (clinton, trump and so on.)
Hopefully, you'll see that Trump was unreasonably represented! We have already run the previous exercise solutions in your environment."""
