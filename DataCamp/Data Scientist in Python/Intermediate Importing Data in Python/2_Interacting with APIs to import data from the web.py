"""Loading and exploring a JSON
Now that you know what a JSON is, you'll load one into your Python environment and explore it yourself. Here, you'll load the JSON 'a_movie.json' into the variable json_data, which will be a dictionary. You'll then explore the JSON contents by printing the key-value pairs of json_data to the shell."""

# Load JSON: json_data
with open("a_movie.json") as json_file:
    json_data = json.load(json_file)

# Print each key-value pair in json_data
for k in json_data.keys():
    print(k + ': ', json_data[k])

Pop quiz: Exploring your JSON
Load the JSON 'a_movie.json' into a variable, which will be a dictionary. Do so by copying, pasting and executing the following code in the IPython Shell:

import json
with open("a_movie.json") as json_file:
    json_data = json.load(json_file)
Print the values corresponding to the keys 'Title' and 'Year' and answer the following question about the movie that the JSON describes:"""    

"""API requests
Now it's your turn to pull some movie data down from the Open Movie Database (OMDB) using their API. The movie you'll query the API about is The Social Network. Recall that, in the video, to query the API about the movie Hackers, Hugo's query string was 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=hackers' and had a single argument t=hackers.

Note: recently, OMDB has changed their API: you now also have to specify an API key. This means you'll have to add another argument to the URL: apikey=72bc447a."""

# Import requests package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=72bc447a&t=the+social+network'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Print the text of the response
print(r.text)


"""JSONâ€“from the web to Python
Wow, congrats! You've just queried your first API programmatically in Python and printed the text of the response to the shell. However, as you know, your response is actually a JSON, so you can do one step better and decode the JSON. You can then print the key-value pairs of the resulting dictionary. That's what you're going to do now!"""

"""Checking out the Wikipedia API
You're doing so well and having so much fun that we're going to throw one more API at you: the Wikipedia API (documented here). You'll figure out how to find and extract information from the Wikipedia page for Pizza. What gets a bit wild here is that your query will return nested JSONs, that is, JSONs with JSONs, but Python can handle that because it will translate them into dictionaries within dictionaries.

The URL that requests the relevant query from the Wikipedia API is

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza"""
