## Introduction to AI Engineering

- ML Engineer vs AI Engineer
    - ML Engineer
        - Focus on building and deploying ML models
        - Data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, deployment
        - Tools: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
    - AI Engineer
        - Focus on building and deploying AI systems
        - ML models, data pipelines, APIs, databases, front-end
        - Tools: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes
    - ML models vs AI systems
        - ML models: standalone, single-purpose, batch processing
        - AI systems: integrated, multi-purpose, real-time processing
