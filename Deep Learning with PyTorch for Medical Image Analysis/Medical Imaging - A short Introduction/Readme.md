### Medical Imaging

- Why is medical imaging important?

    - Medical imaging is a key component of modern healthcare. It is used to diagnose and treat a wide range of diseases and conditions. Medical imaging techniques allow doctors to see inside the body and obtain detailed images of the organs and tissues. This information is used to make accurate diagnoses, plan treatments, and monitor the progress of patients.

    - A simple case study:

        - Young patient comes to emergency room

        - Has had a cold for the past week

        - Experiences sudden onset pain in the right chest region

        - Has difficulty breathing

        - Doctor orders a chest X-ray

        - Chest X-ray shows a large white area in the right lung

        - Diagnosis: Pneumothorax (collapsed lung)

- What is Medical Imaging?

    - Provides spatially resolved information from within the human body.

    - Has a wide range of applications in clinical practice, including:

        - Diagnosis

        - Treatment planning

        - Monitoring of disease progression

    - Is performed using different imaging modalities, such as:

        - Radiography(X-ray imaging)

            - Projection radiography(2D, e.g. chest X-ray imaging)

            - Computed tomography(CT, 3D, e.g. CT scan)

        - Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI, 3D)

        - Ultrasound imaging(2D/3D)

        - Nuclear medicine imaging(PET, SPECT, 3D)
