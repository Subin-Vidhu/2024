### Pytorch Basics

- What is PyTorch?
    - PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package serving two broad purposes:
        - A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs
        - A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed
    - PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python, based on Torch, used for applications such as natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR), and Uber's Pyro software for probabilistic programming is built on it.
    - PyTorch provides two high-level features:
        - Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
        - Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system
    
- PyTorch Tensors
