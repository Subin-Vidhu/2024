# ML Concepts Overview

- What is Machine Learning?

    - Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
    - Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.
    - What is ML used for?
        - Fraud detection
        - Web search results
        - Real-time ads on web pages
        - Credit scoring and next-best offers
        - Prediction of equipment failures
        - New pricing models
        - Network intrusion detection
        - Recommendation engines
        - Customer segmentation
        - Text sentiment analysis
        - Predicting customer churn
        - Pattern and image recognition
        - Email spam filtering
        - Financial modeling
        - Forecasting
        - Data cleaning
        - And many moreâ€¦

     - Neural Networks
        - Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, clustering, and categorizing data.
        - Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning. It involves a neural network with three or more layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. (In deep learning, the hidden layers are typically much larger than the input layer.), so deep learning simply refers to neural networks with more than one hidden layer.
