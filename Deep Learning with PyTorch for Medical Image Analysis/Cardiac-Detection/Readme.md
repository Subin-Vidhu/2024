## Heart Detection

- Predict a bounding box around the heart in the X-ray image.

- Medical background

    - Cardiac Detection indicates size and position of the heart.

        - Cardiomyopath ( heart muscle disease muscle which might lead to heart failure or blood clots) often comes with an increased heart size.

        - Pneumothorax and Atelectasis (collapsed lung) can also be detected by the size and position of the heart.(may lead to cardiac displacement) 

    - Early detection reduces the risk of severe courses and long-term consequences.
