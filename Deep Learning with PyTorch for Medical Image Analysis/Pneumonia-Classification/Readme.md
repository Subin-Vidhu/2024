### Identify signs of pneumonia in chest X-ray images

- Medical background

    - Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and other germs cause the lungs' air sacs to become inflamed and filled with fluid or pus. This can make it difficult for the patient to breathe. Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.
