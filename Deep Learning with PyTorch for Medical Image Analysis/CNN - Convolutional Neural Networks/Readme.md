### CNN

- Understanding the MNIST dataset

    - The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

    - Each image is 28x28 pixels in size.

    - Each pixel in the image is represented by a value between 0 and 255.

    - The dataset is split into two parts:

        - 60,000 images for training (60% of the total dataset).

        - 10,000 images for testing (40% of the total dataset).

    - The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset for training and testing machine learning models.

    - It is often used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
