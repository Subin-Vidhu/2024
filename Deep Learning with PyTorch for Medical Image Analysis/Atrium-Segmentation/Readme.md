### Atrium Segmentation

- **Task**: Automatically segment the left atrium in cardiac MR images.

- Medical Background

    - Atrium Segmentation classifies each voxel in the MRI into either "Not Left Atrium" or "Left Atrium".

    - Enables exact volume measurements of the left atrium.

    - Changes in atrial volume are associated with cardiac disorders, sucha s atrial fibrillation or mitral valve stenosis(Narrowing of the mitral valve orifice, blocking blood flow).

    - Manual segmentation is time-consuming and tedious - Automation is needed.

- Data

    - Medical Segmentation Decathlon dataset[Link](http://medicaldecathlon.com/dataaws/)

    - 20 cardiac MR images with corresponding Ground Truth masks.

        - 4542 2D MRI and label slices.

- Preprocessing

    - Two dimensional setting, Extract slices.

    - Original image shape (352 * 352)

        - Crop away non-cardiac regions and background.

            - 32 pixel from all borders

            - Also applied to segmentation mask
