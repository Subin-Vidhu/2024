# Crash Course Numpy

- What is Numpy?

    - Python library for creating N-dimensional arrays
    - ability to quickly broadcast functions
    - built in linear algebra, statistical distributions, trigonometric and random number capabilities

- Why use Numpy?

    - While numpy structures look similar to standard python lists, they are much more efficient
    - Numpy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can be performed on them much faster
    - Numpy is optimized for numerical operations and is faster than standard python lists
