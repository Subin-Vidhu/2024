- What is a Neural Network?
 
    - A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.
