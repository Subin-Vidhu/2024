<p>1. Go to the game website and familiarise yourself with how it works:</p><p><a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/</a> (classic version)</p><p>2. Create a bot using Selenium and Python to click on the cookie as fast as possible.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-19_14-38-51-b835fee12a1089d1094305f753ee8a9f.png"></figure><p>3. <strong>Every</strong> <strong>5 seconds</strong>, check the right-hand pane to see which upgrades are affordable and purchase the <strong>most expensive one</strong>. You'll need to check how much money (cookies) you have against the price of each upgrade. </p><p>e.g. both Grandma and Cursor are affordable as we have 103 cookies, but Grandma is the more expensive one, so we'll purchase that instead of the cursor.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-19_14-41-26-6f720603b4c24c6bb6cf66ed9da5cf26.png"></figure><p>HINT 1: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp</a></p><p>HINT 2: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_strip.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_strip.asp</a></p><p>HINT 3: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp</a></p><p>HINT 4: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13293269/how-would-i-stop-a-while-loop-after-n-amount-of-time" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13293269/how-would-i-stop-a-while-loop-after-n-amount-of-time</a></p><p>4. After 5 minutes have passed since starting the game, stop the bot and print the "cookies/second". e.g. this is mine:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-19_14-52-01-d5ffd27f6980af9fbf9a8bc37e85eb6c.png"></figure><p>5. Once you've managed to get the bot to work, feel free to tweak the algorithm if you think there is a better way to play the game. e.g. Change the time, instead of every 5 seconds to check the upgrades, what if you did every second. Or maybe the bot should buy all the affordable upgrades. Post your algorithm in the Q&amp;A and impress us all if you manage to get a higher cookies/second with your algo.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/affb3ce61bc79ada90dea26052c27c2b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SOLUTION</a></p>
