<p>In the upcoming lessons, we have created step-by-step instructions to help you complete this project.</p><p>Difficulty <strong>Normal</strong> : Use all Steps to complete the project.</p><p>Difficulty <strong>Hard</strong> : Use only Steps 1 and 2 to complete the project.</p><p>Difficulty <strong>Expert</strong> : Only use Step 1 to complete the project.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>START HERE</strong></p><p>For all difficulty levels, begin by downloading the <strong>turtle-crossing-start.zip</strong> from this lesson's resources and opening it in PyCharm. The starting project contains the starting code for the game, we'll walk through the code in the starting project in the next lesson. </p><p>Alternatively, you can create the entire project from scratch by creating a blank project inside PyCharm and create a Turtle screen that is 600px by 600px. You'll also need to turn off tracer(0) and use update() to refresh the screen every 0.1s. If you are confused about this, just use the starting project instead.</p><p>(If you can't use PyCharm, <a href="https://repl.it/@appbrewery/turtle-crossing-start" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here's a Repl.it link</a>)</p>
