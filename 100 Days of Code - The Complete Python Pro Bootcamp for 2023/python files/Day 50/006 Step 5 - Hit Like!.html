<p>1. The final step is to like some people. Because it's the web version, we don't have to swipe right, all we need to do is to click on the "Like" button. You'll want to add <strong>at least a 1 second delay</strong> between "Likes" so that Tinder doesn't block you because you seem like a bot.</p><figure><img height="132" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-21_15-49-34-7a1f2a27c14e05ceaa2f7833f79b7870.png" width="357"></figure><p>HINT 1: It takes a while for Tinder to load up people near you, this is not a fixed time as it depends on a number of factors. When it's loading, the "Like" button will not be reachable and you will get a <code>NoSuchElementException</code> if you try to find it.
