<p>1. The Facebook login page opens in a new window. In order for our selenium code to work on the new window, we have to switch to the window in front. </p><p>In Selenium, each window has a identification handle, we can get all the window handles with:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">driver.window_handles</pre><p>The above line of code returns a list of all the window handles. The first window is at position 0 e.g.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">base_window = driver.window_handles[0]</pre><p>New windows that have popped out from the base_window are further down in the sequence e.g.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">fb_login_window = driver.window_handles[1]</pre><p>We can switch our Selenium to target the new facebook login window by:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">driver.switch_to.window(fb_login_window)</pre><p>You can print the driver.title to verify that it's the facebook login window that is currently target:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(driver.title)</pre><p>The full code to switch to the new pop-up window is thus:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">base_window = driver.window_handles[0]
fb_login_window = driver.window_handles[1]
driver.switch_to.window(fb_login_window)
print(driver.title)</pre><p>If successful the printed title should be "Facebook" and not "Tinder | Match. Chat. Date."</p><p>2.&nbsp; Using what you have learnt about Selenium, fill in the Facebook login form and submit it to log in. </p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-21_15-33-57-3f82315199d6c26b232010d4be600fd1.png"></figure><p>NOTE: Avoid invoking the Facebook Login too frequently, see if you can test your code without logging in, you don't want to appear like a bot to Facebook as there is always the chance that they might disable your FB account. Alternatively, you can try setting up an alternative Facebook account.</p><p>If successful, you should see the pop-up window disappear and you're back on the Tinder page. e.g.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-21_15-36-03-c39aaf979df1854cc259aebafd8a2ae7.png"></figure><p>3. At this point, you should revert back to the base_window and verify by printing the title of the Selenium controlled window title. </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">driver.switch_to.window(base_window)
print(driver.title)</pre><p>If successful, it should print "Tinder | Match. Chat. Date."</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/15943bd32fd1dc80c728b93172a7b418" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SOLUTION</a></p>
