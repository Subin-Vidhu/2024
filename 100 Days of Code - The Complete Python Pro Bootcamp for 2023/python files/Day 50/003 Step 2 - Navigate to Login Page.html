<p>In order to avoid dual verification with a phone every time we log in, we'll need to use the Facebook/Google login. The Google login flow requires a lot more steps than Facebook login, so we'll go with Facebook in this challenge.</p><p>1. Using Selenium and Python Navigate to the Tinder website (<a href="https://tinder.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://tinder.com/</a>) and click on LOG&nbsp;IN then LOGIN WITH&nbsp;FACEBOOK.

You only have to do this once.</p><p>HINT 2: If you are getting a NoSuchElementException, make sure you've added some delay between clicking on buttons so that the new element has enough time to load.</p><p>HINT 3: You might find it easier to right click on the element and get the XPath to use with Selenium. e.g.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-21_15-17-01-2cdd16603c955114c440cb5ff8e94e95.png"></figure><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/angelabauer/dca25175c22d971db4f63c37ed763b11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SOLUTION</a></p>
