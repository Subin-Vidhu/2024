<p>HINT 1: In order to access Zillow using requests, you'll need to provide your user agent and accepted languages via a header. We've discussed this in the Amazon Price Scraping project in day 47.</p><p><br></p><p>HINT 2: Some of the links you get back from Zillow may be incomplete e.g.</p><figure><img height="92" src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-25_15-56-21-1682117c5c0f856ce772953063f82261.png" width="500"></figure><p>All you need to do is just add https://www.zillow.com in front e.g.</p><p><a href="https://www.zillow.com/b/argenta-san-francisco-ca-5Xj7m7/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.zillow.com/b/argenta-san-francisco-ca-5Xj7m7/</a></p><p><br></p><p>HINT 3: How to get the last element in a list: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/930397/getting-the-last-element-of-a-list" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/930397/getting-the-last-element-of-a-list</a></p><p><br></p><p>HINT 4:&nbsp;Listings with multiple properties have a different structure from listings with a single property only. Use Chrome's Inspect Element to double-check this on Zillow's website. </p><p><br></p><p>If all listings were using the same CSS&nbsp;class to hold the price information, then the 1st pass solution in the course resources would work. See if you can use a try-except structure (covered in day 30) to parse the tree with BeautifulSoup to handle both cases - scrapping the headline price provided for multiple listings as well as the price/mo for single listings.&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>The solution is in the course resources.</p>
