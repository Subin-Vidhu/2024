<p>As we get closer to the latter part of the course, and as you build up your skills every day, the challenges are going to become more life-like and more challenging. As a developer, you will spend most of your time figuring out how to do things using Google and StackOverflow. It's rare that I come across a new project and already know exactly what code I need to write. </p><p>In this capstone project, you will need to apply everything you've learnt about website and web scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium to complete the project and fulfil the project requirements. You might also need to do your own research and revision to complete the task.</p><p>But first, you need to create a new form in Google Forms. </p><p>1. Go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/forms/</a> and create your own form:</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-25_15-17-58-d30a61ad923994f10cb01b2d3c9c0d48.png"></figure><p>2.

Click send and copy the link address of the form. You will need to use this in your program.</p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2020-08-25_15-21-47-ce68f626cee655ddf83ec94b56eb912f.png"></figure><p>4.
