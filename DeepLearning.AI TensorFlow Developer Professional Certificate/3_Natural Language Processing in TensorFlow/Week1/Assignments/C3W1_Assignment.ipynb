    "#### TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:\n",
    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",
    "- Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.\n",
    "- To submit your notebook, save it and then click on the blue submit button at the beginning of the page.\n",

    "\n",
    "The csv is a very common format to store data and you will probably encounter it many times so it is good to be comfortable with it. Your first exercise will be to read the data from the raw csv file so you can analyze it and built models around it. To do so, complete the `parse_data_from_file` function below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since this format is so common there are a lot of ways to deal with this files using python, both using the standard library or third party libraries such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Because of this the implementation details are entirely up to you, **the only requirement is that your function returns the `sentences` and `labels` as regular python lists**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "- Remember the file contains headers so take this into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are unfamiliar with  libraries such as pandas or numpy and you prefer to use python's standard library, take a look at [`csv.reader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader), which lets you iterate over the lines of a csv file. \n",
    "- You can use the [`read_csv`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) function from the pandas library.\n",
    "- You can use the [`loadtxt`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html) function from the numpy library.\n",
    "- If you use any of the two latter approaches remember you still need to convert the `sentences` and `labels` to regular python lists, so take a look at the docs to see how it can be done.\n"
